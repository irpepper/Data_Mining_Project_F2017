VCrystal structure of K-80003-bound RXR-LBD\u000a\u000aTo understand how K-80003 (Supplementary Fig. 1a) modulates the biological activity of tRXR, we determined the crystal structure of RXR-LBD in complex with K-80003 to a resolution of 2.6  (Table 1). We found that the RXR-LBD/K-80003 complex adopts a tetrameric structure, similar to those observed in crystals of apo-RXR or RXR-LBD/tRA-isomer complex22 (Supplementary Fig. 1b), in which two RXR-LBD canonical homodimers (labelled A1/B1 and A2/B2) pack in a bottom-to-bottom manner (Fig. 1a) with point group symmetry D2. Besides the canonical dimer interface32, there are two symmetry-related interfaces involving subunits A1/B2 and B1/A2. These tetramer interfaces comprise three sub-regions: parallel packing between symmetry-related H3 helices; end-to-end packing between H11 that reduces their length by two helical turns (compared with the agonist-bound structure); and the invasion of each H12 helix into its apposing domain, where it binds to the coregulator-binding groove, consisting of elements of H3 and H4 (Fig. 1a). The apposing domain reciprocates the process in a pairwise exchange of C-terminal arms. An LMEML motif near the C terminus of H12 binds to the coregulator groove by mimicking the LxxLL/LxxIL motif of coregulators (Supplementary Fig. 2). The tetramer interfaces create two substantial symmetry-related interfacial cavities that are readily accessible to solvent and small molecules.\u000a\u000aTable 1: Data collection and refinement statistics. Full size table\u000a\u000aFigure 1: Crystal structure of the RXR-LBD tetramer in complex with K-80003. (a) The RXR-LBD tetramer in complex with K-80003. The two biological dimers (A1/B1 and A2/B2) are shown as wheat/yellow and green/cyan cartoons, respectively. The bound K-80003 molecules are shown as brown sticks and blue sticks. Helices contributing to the tetramer interfaces are marked. (b) The orthogonal view showing the hydrophobic void (semitransparent grey) at the interface between the subunits A1 and B2. The smaller pockets and water channels are removed for clarity. 3 K-80003 molecules (K-80003A, B and K-80003C) filling the cavity are shown as blue and brown balls. Full size image\u000a\u000aRefinement of the structure and careful inspection of difference Fourier maps revealed six molecules of K-80003-bound per tetramer, with three molecules per A1/B2 or A2/B1 interfacial cavity (Fig. 1a; Supplementary Fig. 3). This stoichiometry is consistent with values derived by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (Supplementary Fig. 5a). The 2 A1/B2 and A2/B1 interfacial cavities are symmetry-related and the three bound molecules in each cavity (K-80003A, K-80003B and K-80003C, respectively, Fig. 1b) appear to play distinct but complementary roles in stabilizing the tetramer. Thus, K-80003A and K-80003B are arranged about the A1/B2 pseudo-dyad, making similar but distinct interactions (Figs 1b and 2b). They bind in a region where the H12 is located in the agonist-bound RXR-LBD structure (Fig. 2a) and thus distinct from the canonical ligand-binding region. The indene ring of K-80003A makes many interactions with monomer B2, including parallel aromatic stacking with W305, and hydrophobic binding with L276 and L309, and R302. Its isopropylphenyl ring contacts K-80003C. On the other face of K-80003A, there are several hydrophobic/aromatic interactions, including with the side-chains of F439, I447 and L451 from the A1 monomer (Fig. 2b). On the fourth side, to complete the cage around K-80003C, there are numbers of polar and ionic interactions. Notably, the carboxylate of K-80003A makes a bifurcated salt-bridge with K440 from A1 and R302 from B2, as well as an H-bond with the indole N-H of W305 (B2) (Fig. 2b). Thus, K-80003A is firmly encased on all sides at a unique location: by side-chains from A1 and B2 at the top and bottom, by molecule K-80003C on one side, and by elements of the invading H11H12 turn and H12 helix on the other.\u000a\u000aFigure 2: Locations of the bound K-80003 molecules and their interactions with RXR-LBD. (a) Superposition of a monomer subunit (green cartoon) with bound K-80003 molecules K-80003A (brown sticks) and K-80003C (blue/red sticks) on the agonist-binding RXR-LBD (magenta cartoon, PDB code 1FBY, ligand 9-cis-RA in yellow/red stick). (b) Binding of the three K-80003 molecules (blue and brown sticks) at the interface between subunits A1 and B2 of the RXR-LBD tetramer. Selected side-chains of RXR-LBD subunits that interact with the ligands are shown as sticks. Full size image\u000a\u000aFor K-80003B, the symmetry-related packing is similar but distinct with fewer interactions. The ionic interactions with R302 of A1 and K440 of B2 are much weaker, which may explain why K-80003B is less ordered than K-80003A, and with less well-defined electron density. Nevertheless, it makes similar aromatic stacking interactionsin this case, parallel with F439, but a less-optimal (45 stacking angle) with W305 (Fig. 2), as well as hydrophobic interactions with L433 of A1 and L436 of B2.\u000a\u000aK-80003C binds in the pocket of monomer B2, in a mode that resembles a canonical ligand (Fig. 2a). Unlike K-80003A and K-80003B, it makes strong contacts only with the B2 subunit (Fig. 2b). Its carboxyl motif makes a salt-bridge with R316, while the indene ring sits in a broad hydrophobic cavity, and both are well-defined in the electron density map. However, the isopropylbenzene moiety sticks out of the pocket and into the cavity, making only weak contacts with other residues; it presumably adopts multiple conformations, consistent with the weak electron density (Supplementary Fig. 3).\u000a\u000aTaken together, the interactions between the three bound K-80003 molecules and the protein suggest that K-80003 stabilizes RXR-LBD tetramer by a unique combination of distinct and canonical-binding mechanisms acting like a 3-pronged binding mode: K-80003A is tightly packed in a hydrophobic, aromatic and polar cage that strengthens the tetramer and provides additional glue to hold H12 in its place to prevent coregulator binding. K-80003B also contributes to tetramer stabilization, but appears less tightly packed; significantly, however, it blocks the entrance to the unoccupied pocket in monomer A1, which might be otherwise favored by ligands such as 9-cis-RA. K-80003C binds in the pocket in monomer B2 interacting with K-80003A and B2.\u000a\u000aTo understand why K-80003 binds asymmetrically to the tetramer, we closely examined the shape of the tetramers interfacial cavity. Superposition of A1/B2 subunit on to itself reveals that A1/B2 is asymmetric (Supplementary Fig. 4a) with a smaller pocket in monomer A1 than in the B2 monomer (Supplementary Fig. 4b). This asymmetry seems to be resulted from the shifts of H3 and H11 into the pocket in A1 (Supplementary Fig. 4c) and provides an explanation for why small molecules bind asymmetrically to the tetramer22,33. In the previously reported RXR-LBD/tRA-isomer tetramer structure22, tRA-isomer binds to the narrower pocket in monomer A1 where K-80003 molecule is too big to fit in (Supplementary Fig. 4b). In our structure, the large size of the K-80003C molecule presumably selects the wider LBP pocket of the A1/B2 dimer. Despite these differences in ligand binding, the two tetramers have similar overall structures (r.m.s. deviation for C atoms is 1.20 ), and the largest changes are observed at the tetramer interface (Supplementary Fig. 1b), presumably induced by the non-canonical binders, K-80003A and K-80003B.\u000a\u000aK-80003 promotes tetramerization of tRXR but not RXR\u000a\u000aThe unique binding of K-80003 observed in the tetrameric form of K-80003-bound RXR-LBD crystal structure prompted us to determine whether K-80003 binding could promote RXR-LBD tetramerization. In non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, purified RXR-LBD protein existed as two distinct bands corresponding to homodimer and homotetramer, respectively (Fig. 3a). As expected, incubation of RXR with 9-cis-RA known to induce homodimerization18 resulted in a shift of RXR-LBD from tetramers to dimers. In contrast, incubation with K-80003 induced an accumulation of tetramers. L433 near the C terminus of H10 packs directly against the indene ring of K-80003B, and its mutation to D would destabilize key interactions with K-80003 due to loss of existing hydrophobic interaction and introduction of repulsive chargecharge interaction with the carboxyl motif of K-80003B. Indeed, K-80003 failed to bind to RXR-LBD/L433D (Supplementary Fig. 5a) and promote its tetramerization (Fig. 3a). Substitution of Q275 in H3 with E, or F439 in H11 with A, which are involved in the binding of K-80003 (Fig. 2), impaired the tetramerization of respective mutants by K-80003, confirming the role of H3 and H11 in the K-80003-induced stabilization of RXR-LBD tetramers. Interestingly, mutating R316 in LBP, which is essential for 9-cis-RA binding12 and involved in K-80003C binding (Fig. 2b), with E, resulted in a mutant (RXR-LBD/R316E) that exhibited mainly as a tetramer independent of the presence of either 9-cis-RA or K-80003, in agreement with a previous report25. The effect of K-80003 on stabilizing RXR-LBD tetramers appeared overpower the 9-cis-RA-induced homodimerization as RXR-LBD was mainly found as a tetramer in the presence of both K-80003 and 9-cis-RA (Fig. 3a).\u000a\u000aFigure 3: Induction of RXR tetramerization by K-80003 and its regulation by the N-C intramolecular interaction. (a) Equal amounts of purified RXR-LBD or mutant protein were incubated with DMSO, 9-cis-RA, and/or K-80003, and separated by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Bright Blue staining. The percentage of tetramer and dimer of RXR-LBD or mutants was quantitated by densitometric analysis of the corresponding blots. One of four similar experiments is shown. (b) RXR-LBD incubated with K-80003 or 9-cis-RA was subject to gel filtration chromatogram assay. Results showed that 9-cis-RA-induced RXR-LBD was mostly in dimer (D), while K-80003-induced RXR-LBD was mostly in tetramer (T). One of three similar experiments is shown. (c) HepG2 cells transfected with RXR, tRXR or RXR-LBD were treated with 9-cis-RA or K-80003. Cell lysates prepared were then subjected to BS3 crosslinking, and analysed by western blotting using N197 anti-RXR antibody. One of more than five similar experiments is shown. (d) Schematic representations of RXR and mutants. A/B, C, D, E/F domains in RXR are indicated. (e) HepG2 cells transfected with HA-RXR-A/B and Myc-RXR-LBD were treated with 9-cis-RA, and analysed by coIP with anti-HA antibody. One of two similar experiments is shown. (f) Inhibition of K-80003-induced tRXR tetramerization by A/B domain. HEK293T cells transfected with tRXR together with RXR-A/B were treated with K-80003. Cell lysates were subjected to BS3 crosslinking, and analysed by western blotting using N197 anti-RXR antibody. One of three similar experiments is shown. (g) RXR-A/B interaction with RXR N-terminal deletion mutants. HA-RXR-A/B and Myc-tagged RXR N-terminal deletion mutants were transfected in to HEK293T cells, and their interaction was analysed by coIP. (h) Interaction of RXR-A/B with RXR mutants. HA-RXR-A/B and Myc-tagged RXR-mutants were transfected together in to HEK293T cells, and their interaction was analysed by coIP. One of three similar experiments is shown. (i) Mutation of Trp305 does not affect N/C interaction. Myc-tagged RXR-LBD or RXR-LBD/W305Q was transfected together with HA-RXR-A/B into HEK293T cells in the presence or absence of 9-cis-RA (107 M). Cell lysates were prepared and analysed by coIP. Full size image\u000a\u000aThe ability of K-80003 to stabilize RXR-LBD tetramer was also illustrated by gel filtration chromatography showing that purified RXR-LBD protein mainly existed as a tetramer in the presence of K-80003, while it displayed predominantly as a homodimeric complex in the presence of 9-cis-RA (Fig. 3b). Evaluation of a panel of chemical crosslinkers identified homobifunctional N-hydroxysuccimide-based chemical cross-linker BS3 as the most efficient one to crosslink the RXR-LBD tetramer (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Thus, BS3 was subsequently used to study the effect of K-80003 on RXR tetramerization. Extracts from cells transfected with RXR-LBD and treated with either K-80003 or 9-cis-RA were prepared and subsequently incubated with BS3. Figure 3c showed that the treatment of cells with K-80003 produced crosslinked species on SDS-PAGE gels of 25, 50 and 100 kDa, corresponding to monomer, dimer and tetramer of RXR-LBD, respectively. For comparison, treatment with 9-cis-RA resulted in only monomer and homodimer. Interestingly, RXR or mutants expressed in cells mainly existed as a monomer even after crosslinking, which is different from purified RXR proteins. Examination of the effect of K-80003 on tetramerization of tRXR and RXR revealed that K-80003 effectively promoted the formation of tRXR tetramers. Unexpectedly, K-80003 failed to promote the tetramerization of the full-length RXR, indicating that the N-terminal A/B domain interferes with its tetramerization.\u000a\u000aThe RXR N/C interaction inhibits its tetramerization\u000a\u000aThe above observation prompted us to determine how the N-terminal A/B domain of RXR inhibited its tetramerization (Fig. 1). Thus, the interaction between RXR-A/B domain and RXR-LBD (Fig. 3d) was studied by cell-based coimmunoprecipitation (coIP) assays. Immunoprecipitation of the RXR-A/B protein resulted in a strong coIP of the RXR-LBD protein, demonstrating their interaction. The interaction was inhibited by 9-cis-RA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3e), and was confirmed by immunostaining showing extensive colocalization of transfected RXR-A/B with RXR-LBD but not RXR in the cytoplasm of cells (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Cotransfection of the RXR A/B domain completely suppressed the effect of K-80003 on promoting tRXR tetramerization (Fig. 3f). These data reveal an extensive intramolecular interaction between the N terminus and the C terminus (N/C) in RXR and its critical role in regulating RXR tetramerization, and also provides a molecular explanation for the differential effect of K-80003 on the tetramerization of tRXR and RXR.\u000a\u000aTo further study the N/C interaction, we first conducted deletion analysis of the N-terminal A/B region to narrow down the region required for the interaction. Deletion of either the N-terminal 40 or 60 amino acids could not confer the ability of the resulting mutants to interact with the A/B domain (Fig. 3g). Deletion of additional 20 amino acids resulted in a mutant (tRXR), which strongly interacted with the RXR-A/B protein. RXR-60, like tRXR, interacted strongly with RAR (Supplementary Fig. 6b), demonstrating that RXR-60 is still active in heterodimerization with RAR. These results suggested that amino acids from 60 to 80 are critical for the N/C interaction. We next determined region in RXR-LBD required for binding A/B domain. RXR-A/B could interact with RXR mutants lacking N-terminal sequences (tRXR, RXR-100 and RXR-LBD) but not with mutant lacking C-terminal LBD (RXR-1-235) or mutants lacking AF2/H12 region (RXR-AF2 and RXR-A/BAF2) (Fig. 3h). tRXR without AF2/H12 also failed to interact with RXR-A/B (Supplementary Fig. 6c). Thus, the N/C intramolecular interaction involves the N-terminal A/B domain and the C-terminal AF2/H12. The conclusion was supported by data showing the inability of the A/B domain to bind to the full-length RXR, likely due to the unavailability of the C-terminal binding site masked by its own N-terminal A/B domain. The AF2/H12 is involved in the formation of the hydrophobic coactivator-binding groove that was shown to mediate the N/C interaction of some nuclear receptors34,35. To determine whether the N/C interaction involves the coactivator-binding groove, we tested whether W305, which is located in H5 and was shown to play a critical role in the formation of the coactivator-binding groove12, was involved in the N/C interaction. Our results showed that RXR-LBD/W305Q with W305 mutated to Q, which failed to bind to an LxxLL-containing protein (see below), could still bind to the RXR-A/B protein in a 9-cis-RA sensitive manner similar to the wild-type RXR-LBD (Fig. 3i). These results preclude the involvement of the coactivator-binding groove in the N/C interaction.\u000a\u000aAn LxxLL motif in p85 mediates p85 interaction with RXR\u000a\u000atRXR differs from RXR in its ability to reside in the cytoplasm and interact with cytoplasmic p85 protein, an event that is inhibited by K-80003 (ref. 29). To address the role of tetramerization in modulating tRXR interaction with p85, we first determined how p85 binds to tRXR. Thus, several p85 mutants (Fig. 4a) were constructed and analysed for their interaction with tRXR. CoIP experiments showed that the N-terminal region of p85, including the N-terminal SH3 and BCR domains, is sufficient for interacting with tRXR, whereas the C-terminal region including NSH2, iSH2 and CSH2 domains was dispensable (Fig. 4b). We further observed that a p85 mutant encompassing only the BCR domain could interact with tRXR and RXR-LBD but not RXR-A/B (Fig. 4c).\u000a\u000aFigure 4: Identification of an LxxLL-like motif in p85 and its interaction with the coactivator-binding groove in tRXR. (a) Schematic representations of p85 and mutants. SH3, BCR, nSH2, iSH2, cSH2 domains in p85 and the location of the BCR-LxxLL motif are indicated. BCR and mutant peptides are shown. (b) Interaction of tRXR with p85 mutants. Myc-tRXR expression vector was transfected into HEK293T cells along or together with p85 mutant tagged with HA epitope, and their interaction was analysed by coIP using anti-Myc antibody. (c) BCR domain interaction with RXR mutants. HA-p85-BCR was cotransfected with Myc-tagged RXR mutants into HEK293T cells, and their interaction was analysed by coIP using anti-HA antibody. (d) The BCR-LxxLL peptide (structure was extracted from the BCR crystal structure of PDB code 1PBW) docks to the coactivator-binding groove on RXR (PDB code 3FUG). (e) SPR analysis of BCR-peptide binding to RXR-LBD in the presence of 9-cis-RA. (f) Enhancing effect of 9-cis-RA on p85-BCR interaction with RXR-LBD and tRXR. Cells transfected with Myc-tRXR or Myc-RXR-LBD together with HA-p85-BCR were treated with 9-cis-RA (107 M), and analysed by coIP. One of two similar experiments is shown. (g) Inhibitory effect of LxxLL-containing BCR peptide on RXR-LBD interaction with p85-BCR. HEK293T cells transfected with HA-p85-BCR and Myc-RXR-LBD were exposed to the indicated peptide and compound for 12 h. Cell lysates were prepared and analysed by coIP. (h) Mutation of the LxxLL motif in BCR impairs its interaction with RXR-LBD. BCR and BCR-LxxLL mutant were tagged with Flag epitope and transfected into A549 cells with Myc-RXR-LBD. Cell lysates were prepared and analysed for interaction of BCR and its mutant with RXR-LBD by coIP. (i) Trp305 is essential for RXR-LBD binding to p85-BCR. Myc-tagged RXR-LBD or RXR-LBD/W305Q was transfected together with HA-p85-BCR into HEK293T cells in the presence or absence of 9-cis-RA (107 M). Cell lysates were prepared and analysed by coIP. For western blotting, one of three or four similar experiments is shown. Full size image\u000a\u000aIn an effort to understand the molecular basis for BCR interaction with tRXR, we noticed the presence of two LxxLL motifs, 161LRQLL165 and 240LQYLL244, in BCR, which are commonly found in coactivators that mediates the transactivation of nuclear receptors10,13,14,15,16. Inspection of both motifs in the published BCR structure36 revealed that the 240LQYLL244 motif is buried in the central core of the BCR domain, while the 161LRQLL165 motif is located in a separate helix within a loop region. The 161LRQLL165 motif docks well to the coactivator-binding groove of RXR (Fig. 4d), suggesting that the motif might be critical for RXR binding. A peptide (BCR peptide) that encompasses the 161LRQLL165 motif (Fig. 4a) was therefore synthesized and examined for its binding to RXR-LBD by Biacore assay. The peptide binds strongly to RXR-LBD in the presence of 9-cis-RA with a K d of 320 nM (Fig. 4e), which is in the range of coregulator peptide binding to nuclear receptor37. The role of the 161LRQLL165 motif was also illustrated by the enhancing effect of 9-cis-RA on p85-BCR interaction with either RXR-LBD or tRXR (Fig. 4f). Furthermore, 9-cis-RA-induced RXR-LBD interaction with p85-BCR was inhibited by the LxxLL-containing BCR peptide conjugated with the cell-penetrating peptide derived from trans-activator of transcription (TAT), similar to the effect of K-80003, but not by the corresponding mutant peptide (Fig. 4g). Substitution of L164 and L165 in 161LRQLL165 motif with A also abolished the interaction of BCR with RXR-LBD (Fig. 4h). Mutating W305 critical for the formation of the coactivator-binding groove12 to Q impaired the binding of RXR-LBD with p85-BCR either in the presence or absence of 9-cis-RA (Fig. 4i), even though the same mutation had no effect on RXR-LBD interaction with RXR-A/B (Fig. 3i). The interaction of the LxxLL-like motif in p85 with the coactivator-binding groove of tRXR is biologically relevant as TNF-induced activation of AKT in cells transfected with tRXR and p85 was inhibited by cotransfection of BCR but not BCR mutant, similar to the inhibitory effect of K-80003 (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Exposure of cells to BCR peptide also resulted in a similar inhibition (Supplementary Fig. 7b). Altogether, these results demonstrate that the LxxLL motif in p85 can bind to the coactivator-binding groove of RXR in analogy to the binding of transcriptional coactivators.\u000a\u000aTetramerization prevents tRXR from interacting with p85\u000a\u000aTo further characterize the coactivator-like binding of p85, we studied the requirement of AF2/H12 in tRXR, which is essential for the formation of the coactivator-binding groove12,38, for tRXR interaction with p85. As previously reported29, tRXR interacted with the full-length p85 in the presence of TNF. Removing AF2/H12 from tRXR (tRXR/AF2) abolished its interaction with p85 (Fig. 5a). Interfering AF2/H12 activity by transfecting RXR-A/B capable of binding AF2/H12 also inhibited 9-cis-RA-induced interaction of tRXR with p85-iSH2 (Fig. 5b). These results further support the coactivator-like binding of p85.\u000a\u000aFigure 5: Tetramerization of tRXR prevents its interaction with p85. (a) AF2/H12 is required for binding p85. HEK293T cells transfected with HA-p85 and Myc-tRXR or mutants were treated with TNF (10 ng ml1) for 1 h, and analysed by coIP assay using anti-Myc antibody. (b) Regulation of tRXR interaction with p85 by ligand and RXR-A/B region. HEK293T cells transfected with the indicated HA-p85-iSH2, Myc-tRXR and RXR-A/B were treated with or without 9-cis-RA (107 M) for 6 h, and analysed by coIP assay using anti-Myc antibody. (c) Tetramerization of tRXR/R316E and tRXR/F313A was analysed in MCF-7 cells transfected with tRXR/R316E or tRXR/F313A, which were then treated with 9-cis-RA (107 M) or K-80003 (5  106 M) for 6 h. Cell lysates were subjected to BS3 crosslinking and analysed by western blotting using N197 anti-RXR antibody. (d) Interaction of tRXR/R316E and tRXR/F313A with p85. HEK293T cells transfected with the indicated expression plasmids were treated with TNF (10 ng ml1) or 9-cis-RA (107 M) for 1 h, and analysed by coIP assay using anti-Myc antibody. (e) Characterization of p85 interaction with tRXR/R316E or tRXR/F313A. HEK293T cells transfected with the indicated expression plasmids were treated with 9-cis-RA (107 M) or K-80003 (5  106 M) for 6 h., and analysed by coIP assay using anti-HA antibody. (f) Mutation of R316 impairs tRXR cytoplasmic localization. HEK293T cells cotransfected with Myc-tRXR/R316E and HA-p85 were pretreated with K-80003 (5  106 M) for 3 h before exposed to TNF (10 ng ml1) for 30 min. Cells were immunostained with anti-Myc and anti-p85 antibody, and visualized by confocal microscopy. Scale bar, 10 m. (g) Tetramerization of tRXR impairs its interaction with p85. HepG2 cells transfected with Myc-tRXR together with HA-p85-iSH2 were treated with K-80003 and or 9-cis-RA. Cell lysates were then subjected to BS3 crosslinking, and analysed by western blotting using anti-Myc antibody. (h) Tetramerization of RXR-LBD impairs its interaction with p85-BCR. HEK293T cells transfected with Myc-RXR-LBD together with HA-p85-BCR were treated with K-80003. Cell lysates were subjected to BS3 crosslinking, and analysed by western blotting using anti-HA antibody. For western blotting, one of three or four similar experiments is shown. Full size image\u000a\u000aBecause the coactivator-binding groove of RXR was shielded in the tetrameric form of RXR-LBD (Fig. 1), our observation that the LxxLL-like motif in p85 interacted with the coactivator-binding groove of RXR implied that the p85-binding activity of tRXR is impaired in its tetrameric form. To address this, we evaluated the binding of p85 by two tRXR mutants, tRXR/F313A and tRXR/R316E, which exist in different oligomeric forms25. RXR/F313A is a transcriptionally constitutively active mutant receptor with H12 adopting an active conformation to form the coactivator-binding groove39. The mutant does not exist as a tetramer as its H12 is not available to contribute to the formation of tetramers25. In contrast, tRXR/R316E, a transcriptionally inactive mutant, exhibited predominantly as a tetramer25. In agreement with previous observations25, our cross-link experiments detected a strong tetrameric species of tRXR/R316E but not tRXR/F313A independent of the presence of 9-cis-RA or K-80003 (Fig. 5c). When both mutants were analysed for their interaction with p85 by coIP experiments, we found that tRXR/R316E could not bind to p85 either in the absence or presence of TNF or 9-cis-RA, whereas tRXR/F313A showed a constitutive and 9-cis-RA-independent interaction with p85 compared to tRXR (Fig. 5d). K-80003 also failed to modulate the interaction of both mutants with p85 (Fig. 5e). Immunostaining revealed lack of colocalization of the tRXR/R316E mutant with p85 in the absence or presence of TNF (Fig. 5f). To further determine the inhibitory effect of tRXR tetramerization, we examined the interaction of p85-iSH2 with tRXR tetramers crosslinked by BS3. Cells transfected with HA-p85-iSH2 and Myc-tRXR were treated with 9-cis-RA and/or K-80003, and subsequently exposed to BS3. 9-cis-RA-induced tRXR interaction with p85-iSH2 was potently inhibited by BS3 that stabilized tRXR tetramers (Fig. 5g). Furthermore, the monomeric form but not the tetrameric form of RXR-LBD interacted with p85-BCR (Fig. 5h). These results together with our structural information demonstrate that K-80003 inhibits tRXR interaction with p85 by promoting tRXR tetramerization that masks the p85-binding region on tRXR.\u000a\u000aTetramerization regulates tRXR subcellular localization\u000a\u000aThe interaction of tRXR with p85 occurs in the cytoplasm29. We next determined whether K-80003-induced stabilization of tRXR tetramers could modulate its subcellular localization. When transfected into cells, both tRXR and RXR resided mainly (>80%) in the nucleus. However, upon TNF treatment tRXR was found in the cytoplasm of cells (>65%), colocalizing extensively with p85. In contrast, TNF had no effect on the nuclear localization of RXR. When cells were cotreated with K-80003, TNF-induced colocalization of tRXR with p85 in the cytoplasm was inhibited, resulting in tRXR nuclear localization (Fig. 6a). The effect of K-80003 was likely due to its binding to tRXR as the cytoplasmic colocalization of p85 with tRXR/L433D mutant defective in K-80003 binding was not affected by K-80003. Thus, TNF-induced cytoplasmic localization of tRXR was likely due to its cytoplasmic retention by TNF-activated p85 through protein/protein interaction, suggesting that tRXR tetramers incapable of binding p85 might reside in the nucleus. To address this, extracts prepared from cells transfected with tRXR were subjected to crosslinking by BS3. Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were then prepared and analysed. Western blotting showed that K-80003-stabilized tetrameric form of tRXR was found exclusively in the nuclear fraction, while tRXR monomer was distributed both in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (Fig. 6b). Thus, K-80003-stabilized tRXR tetramer is mainly nuclear, likely resulted from tRXR dissociation from p85 or other cytoplasmic proteins.\u000a\u000aFigure 6: Effect of tetramerization on the subcellular localization of tRXR. (a) Effect of TNF and K-80003. MCF-7 cells cotransfected with Myc-RXR, Myc-tRXR, tRXR/L433D and p85 were pretreated with or without K-80003 (5  106 M) for 3 h before exposed to TNF (10 ng ml1) for 30 min. Cells were immunostained with anti-Myc and anti-p85 antibody, and their subcellular localization revealed by confocal microscopy. (b) Tetrameric tRXR resides in the nucleus. HEK293T cells cotransfected with Myc-tRXR were treated with or without K-80003 (5  106 M) for 6 h. Nuclear (N) and cytoplasmic (C) fractions were prepared, subjected to BS3 crosslinking, and analysed by western blotting using anti-Myc antibody. The purity of fractions was examined by analysing the expression of nuclear PARP and cytoplasmic -tubulin in non-crosslinked fractions. One of three similar experiments is shown. (c) Effect of K-80003 on the growth of MCF-7 cells in mice. Nude mice injected with MCF-7 cells stably transfected with control vector, Myc-RXR, or Myc-tRXR were administered with K-80003 (20 mg kg1) for 12 days. *P<0.05; **P<0.01. (d) Effect of K-80003 on PARP cleavage and AKT activation in MCF-7 xenograft tumours. Lysates prepared from tumours from nude mice treated with vehicle or K-80003 were analysed by western blotting. (e) K-80003 alters the subcellular localization of tRXR in MCF-7 xenograft tumour cells. Tumour sections prepared from nude mice treated with vehicle or K-80003 were immunostained with anti-Myc antibody. (f) Effect of K-80003 on the growth of MMTV-PyMT mammary tumour. Four-week old MMTV-PyMT mice were fed with or without diet containing K-80003 (100 mg kg1) for 4 weeks, and the appearance of tumour was determined. **P<0.01. (g) Effect of K-80003 on PARP cleavage and cyclin D1 expression in MMTV-PyMT mammary tumour cells. Lysates prepared from tumours from MMTV-PyMT mice fed with vehicle or K-80003 were analysed by western blotting. (h) K-80003 induces RXR nuclear localization in MMTV-PyMT tumour cells. Tumour sections from MMTV-PyMT mice fed with or without K-80003 (100 mg kg1) for 4 weeks were immunostained with N197 anti-RXR antibody. Scale bar, 10 m. Full size image\u000a\u000aTo study whether the anti-tumour effect of K-80003 could be attributed to its effect on the subcellular localization of tRXR in vivo, we stably transfected tRXR or RXR into MCF-7 cells, and the resulting stable clones (Supplementary Fig. 8a) were inoculated into nude mice. Overexpression of tRXR but not RXR in MCF-7 breast cancer cells enhanced AKT activation in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 8b) and promoted the growth of MCF-7 tumour in animals, which was suppressed when animal were treated with K-80003 (Fig. 6c; Supplementary Fig. 8c). Inhibition of the growth of MCF-7/tRXR tumour by K-80003 was accompanied with reduced AKT activation and enhanced PARP cleavage (Fig. 6d). To determine whether the anti-cancer activity of K-80003 was associated with its modulation of tRXR subcellular localization, tumour specimens from nude mice were analysed by RXR immunostaining (Fig. 6e). While RXR was nuclear, tRXR was predominantly cytoplasmic. However, a significant amount of tRXR was found in the nucleus when animals were administered with K-80003. We also used polyomavirus middle T antigen (PyMT) transgenic mice40 to study the anti-cancer effect of K-80003 and its modulation of the subcellular localization of tRXR, which was highly expressed in PyMT mammary tumour developed in these mice (Supplementary Fig. 9a). K-80003 potently inhibited the growth of PyMT mammary tumour in this animal model (Fig. 6f), accompanied with induction of PARP cleavage and inhibition of cyclin D expression (Fig. 6g) as well as inhibition of tumour cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 9b). Immunostaining of PyMT tumour specimens using 197 anti-RXR antibody that recognizes both RXR and tRXR revealed a predominant cytoplasmic RXR staining (Fig. 6h). In contrast, RXR staining was mainly found in the nucleus when mice were dosed with K-80003. Thus, K-80003 induction of tRXR nuclear localization through its modulation of tRXR tetramerization likely represents a major mechanism by which the compound exerts its potent therapeutic effect.
