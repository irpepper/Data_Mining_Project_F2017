VAbstract Avian mortality events are common following large-scale oil spills. However, the sublethal effects of oil on birds exposed to light external oiling are not clearly understood. We found that American oystercatchers (area of potential impact n = 42, reference n = 21), black skimmers (area of potential impact n = 121, reference n = 88), brown pelicans (area of potential impact n = 91, reference n = 48), and great egrets (area of potential impact n = 57, reference n = 47) captured between 20 June 2010 and 23 February 2011 following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill experienced oxidative injury to erythrocytes, had decreased volume of circulating erythrocytes, and showed evidence of a regenerative hematological response in the form of increased reticulocytes compared with reference populations. Erythrocytic inclusions consistent with Heinz bodies were present almost exclusively in birds from sites impacted with oil, a finding pathognomonic for oxidative injury to erythrocytes. Average packed cell volumes were 4 to 19% lower and average reticulocyte counts were 27 to 40% higher in birds with visible external oil than birds from reference sites. These findings provide evidence that small amounts of external oil exposure are associated with hemolytic anemia. Furthermore, we found that some birds captured from the area impacted by the spill but with no visible oiling also had erythrocytic inclusion bodies, increased reticulocytes, and reduced packed cell volumes when compared with birds from reference sites. Thus, birds suffered hematologic injury despite no visible oil at the time of capture. Together, these findings suggest that adverse effects of oil spills on birds may be more widespread than estimates based on avian mortality or severe visible oiling. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;9999:111.  2017 SETAC\u000a\u000aINTRODUCTION Oil spills can have substantial and long-term effects on ecosystems. Seabirds, waterfowl, and colonial waterbirds are at particular risk; and extensive avian mortality has been described for many large-scale oil spills, such as the Exxon Valdez [1], Prestige [2], and more recently, Deepwater Horizon [3]. Acute mortality data are used to assess effects on natural resources and ultimately to direct mitigation and restoration efforts. Acute mortality data alone, however, likely underestimate the more widespread effects of oil exposure on individuals and long-term consequences on populations and ecosystems [1, 4, 5]. Prolonged adverse effects of oil spills include ongoing population declines after the initial mortality event and slow population recovery [6], but the effects of modest oil exposure on individuals remain poorly understood [7-9]. Because sublethal exposure (i.e., a small amount of external oiling that does not lead to death) puts more birds at risk than are represented by acute mortality data, a thorough understanding of the adverse effects of light oiling is important. Exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) found in crude oil and metabolites formed through metabolic enzymes (e.g., cyp450) triggers an array of pathologic effects in birds, including inflammation, immunosuppression, and oxidative damage to cells [8, 10-12]. These sublethal effects can adversely affect growth, alter organ function, reduce reproductive success, and increase risk of disease, thereby reducing fitness in individuals and ultimately affecting populations on a larger scale than mortality events alone [8, 9, 12-15]. Of the sublethal responses following exposure to crude oil, oxidative damage to erythrocytes and subsequent anemia are of particular interest because these changes can be evaluated from single blood samples taken from live birds. Exposure to PAHs and their metabolites can result in oxidative injury to cytoplasmic hemoglobin, and aggregates of this damaged hemoglobin can be highlighted by cell staining techniques (e.g., new methylene blue vital staining) that reveal inclusion bodies within erythrocytes [16, 17]. These aggregations of denatured hemoglobin, called Heinz body inclusions (also, Heinz-Ehrlich bodies), are pathognomonic for oxidative damage to erythrocytes. Subsequent to injury, these damaged, abnormal erythrocytes undergo lysis (i.e., hemolysis). Heinz body hemolytic anemia can induce fatigue and reduce energy availability for metabolic processes [18]. Hemolytic anemia has been demonstrated in several species of birds exposed to crude oil under experimental and natural conditions, and in cases where vital staining techniques were used, Heinz body inclusions were found within erythrocytes [19-23]. Although some of these studies provide evidence of a relation between oil exposure, PAH levels in the blood, and Heinz bodies, they focus on a limited number of species and rely on relatively heavy oiling or large experimental oral doses of oil. Thus, further work is needed to understand variation in species-specific hematological responses, especially for the light and moderate oil exposures that are likely more prevalent in most oil spill events. In the present study, we evaluated the hematologic response of birds exposed to oil from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The Deepwater Horizon was the largest accidental offshore oil spill in history, releasing an estimated 4.9 million barrels (210 000 000 US gallons,  10%) into the Gulf of Mexico [24]. Surface oil from this spill ultimately affected more than 175 000 km2 of surface water and coastal marshes in the Gulf of Mexico [25]. We evaluated the relationships between visible oiling, a suite of hematologic endpoints, and plasma proteins associated with oxidative hemolysis. Based on the existing literature, we made a priori predictions of the biological response of birds exposed to the Deepwater Horizon spill (Figure 1). Unlike other studies that have predominantly focused on heavily oiled birds, the present approach provides a comprehensive assessment of the hematological effects of trace and light amounts of crude oil on these species (Figure 1) [20, 22, 23].

Included are a priori predictions of the response of variables Heinz bodies, reticulocytes, hemoglobin, packed cell volume, red blood cell count, ferritin, haptoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and mean cell volume to oil exposure.

We focused the present study on American oystercatchers (Haematopus palliatus), black skimmers (Rynchops niger), brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis), and great egrets (Ardea alba). These species were selected because they are common in the area affected by the spill and represent a diversity of ecological niches which could influence their relative susceptibility to oil exposure [26]. We captured all birds from 20 June 2010 until 23 February 2011. Age classes and sex were similar between reference sites and areas of potential impact. We captured American oystercatchers (area of potential impact n = 43, reference n = 21) and black skimmers (area of potential impact n = 121, reference n = 88) with decoy-noose traps, box traps, and cannon nets; brown pelicans (area of potential impact n = 91, reference n = 48) with noose and padded leg-hold traps; and great egrets (area of potential impact n = 57, reference n = 47) with net guns (Table 1). Table 1.

Reference sites included various locations along coastal South Carolina and Georgia, USA, where no recent oiling events had been recorded. All reference capture sites were pooled, and all capture sites from areas of potential impact were pooled for comparisons of these 2 categories of sites. Visible oiling We evaluated the majority of birds captured in both reference sites and areas of potential impact for evidence of visible oiling and assigned an oiling score of none (0% of plumage affected with visible oil), trace (<5% plumage affected), light (620% plumage affected), moderate (2140% plumage affected), or heavy (>40% plumage affected) [26]. Blood collection and sample handling We collected blood from the medial metatarsal vein or superficial ulnar vein using 21 or 23G butterfly needles and deposited it directly into lithium heparin and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) vacutainers as well as heparinized hematocrit tubes. The volume of blood collected was less than 10% of circulating blood volume, which we assumed to be 8% of body mass. Immediately following blood collection, we prepared new methylene bluestained blood smears in the field to quantify Heinz bodies and reticulocytes. Blood samples in vacutainers and hematocrit tubes were maintained on ice and transferred to a field laboratory within 12 h of collection. Heparinized plasma was promptly separated from cells via centrifugation and transferred to cryovials. Heparinized plasma for ferritin and haptoglobin-like protein analyses was frozen and stored at 80 C until processing. We quantified erythrocytic inclusions consistent with Heinz bodies, reticulocytes, packed cell volume, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, red blood cell count, mean cell volume, haptoglobin-like protein, and ferritin. In all cases, individuals performing these analyses were blinded to oiling status, capture location, and results of other analyses. Heinz bodies and reticulocytes To prepare the new methylene bluestained slides in the field, we transferred 25 L of blood from the EDTA vacutainer to a 0.5-mL centrifuge tube containing 25 L of new methylene blue stain [17]. We mixed this combination, allowed it to incubate for 20 min, and then prepared 2 blood smears via the standard 2-slide technique. We evaluated slides within 72 h of collection. We identified Heinz bodies as blue-staining inclusion bodies within erythrocytes or, less commonly, found along the cell margin. Retained reticular material has an affinity for new methylene blue stain and is common in avian erythrocytes. However, the less intense stain affinity and relatively uniform size of the Heinz body inclusions distinguished them from the cytoplasmic organelle material and retained reticular material [11]. Cells that have sustained oxidative damage undergo lysis or are removed from the circulation, resulting in a reduced packed cell volume and red blood cell count, which subsequently triggers the release of young erythrocytes, termed reticulocytes, from hematopoietic centers [27]. We identified reticulocytes as erythrocytes with reticular remnants encircling >50% of the circumference of the nucleus [28]. We counted 1000 erythrocytes under a 1000 light microscope, noting the number of cells affected by Heinz bodies as well as the number of reticulocytes. Packed cell volume, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, red blood cell count, and mean cell volume Diagnostic features of anemia include reduced packed cell volume, hemoglobin, or red blood cell count [27]. We determined packed cell volume (percentage) and hemoglobin (grams per deciliter) from heparinized samples within 12 h of collection. We calculated packed cell volume using a standard hematocrit reader following centrifugation at 11 000 rpm for 5 min. Total hemoglobin was quantified using a Hemocue Hb Analyzer Hb201. We estimated red blood cell count (cells per cubic millimeter) via standard manual methodology using a hemocytometer at a commercial laboratory (Avian and Exotics Clin Path Lab). With hemolytic anemia, the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, or the average hemoglobin per cell, typically does not change from baseline concentration or may be artifactually increased as a result of free hemoglobin in the bloodstream. We calculated mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (grams per deciliter) by dividing the total hemoglobin  100 by packed cell volume (expressed as a proportion) [16]. Vertebrates respond to oxidative hemolytic anemia with a regenerative response, resulting in increased number of reticulocytes in the circulation. In most species, these cells tend to be larger than mature erythrocytes, leading to an increase in mean cell volume. We calculated mean cell volume (femtoliters per cell) as 10  packed cell volume (as a proportion) divided by red blood cell count. Plasma haptoglobin-like protein and ferritin In addition to hematologic changes following exposure to crude oil, there is evidence that concentrations of the plasma proteins haptoglobin-like protein and ferritin may be correlated with oxidative hemolysis [23]. An acute-phase glycoprotein, haptoglobin-like protein functions primarily to bind free hemoglobin and during hemolytic anemia may be depleted, resulting in low plasma concentration [23, 29-31]. Ferritin is also important in this cascade because it functions to store free iron and has been demonstrated to increase in cases of PAH-induced hemolytic anemia in oiled guillemots (Figure 1) [23]. We determined plasma haptoglobin-like protein (milligrams per milliliter) levels using a standard microplate colorimetric assay following the manufacturer's specifications (Tri-Delta Phase range haptoglobin colorimetric bioassay). Levey-Jennings charts were maintained throughout the present study to evaluate for systematic and random error. Using high and low control samples, the average interassay coefficient of variation was 4.8%. Using results from replicate samples, the average intra-assay coefficient of variation was 5.5%. These results are similar to those reported by the manufacturer. We determined plasma ferritin using a standard colorimetric assay [23, 32]. Ferritin standards derived from purified equine spleen ranged from 18.75 to 300 ng/mL. We prepared a protein precipitation solution (10% w/v trichloroacetic acid, 3% w/v HCl plus 40% v/v thioglycolic acid) and color reagent (1.5M sodium acetate containing bathophenanthroline disulfonic acid). We added 25 L of protein precipitation solution to 25 L of each prepared standard, samples, controls, and blanks. Then, we gently vortexed mixtures and incubated them at 56 C for 15 min, before cooling on ice. We then added 150 L of color developing solution and allowed mixtures to incubate at 25 C for 5 min. We centrifuged these at 2490 g for 5 min, then transferred 150 L of supernatant to microplate wells in duplicate and read the plate at 535 nm absorbance immediately. We employed standard quality-assurance procedures including analysis of standard reference materials, duplicate samples, method blanks, and laboratory control samples with each analytical batch. The average interassay coefficient of variation was 5.4%, and the average intra-assay coefficient of variation was 6.1%. Statistical analyses We used SAS software (Ver 9.3; SAS Institute) and R 3.0.0 (Foundation for Statistical Computing) for all analyses. Where appropriate, we evaluated normality and homogeneity of variance using graphing methods and Shapiro-Wilk and Levene tests, respectively. Because of the large number of individual birds for which we had missing values for one or more variables (primarily attributable to limited blood volume from some individuals), we used a series of univariate statistical tests rather than taking a multivariate approach. Because data were not normally distributed, we used nonparametric tests in these analyses. To account for the lack of independence of hematologic responses compared in our univariate models, we applied a conservative   0.01 to assess significance, while also noting cases where  > 0.01 and   0.05. Oil exposure risk and PAH absorption and metabolism are likely species-dependent because of differences in behavior and physiological differences in absorption and metabolism of petroleum. Likewise, the biological responses to PAHs and PAH metabolites, such as changes in erythrocytes or biochemical variables, are also likely species-dependent. Therefore, we first evaluated whether species differed in severity of visible oiling and the suite of physiological variables for each capture site type (reference sites and areas of potential impact) using Kruskal-Wallis tests with species as the independent variable. We then analyzed blood endpoints separately for each species. To determine the effects of visible oiling on Heinz body formation, reticulocytes, packed cell volume, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, red blood cell count, mean cell volume, ferritin, and haptoglobin-like protein, we used Kruskal-Wallis tests with subsequent post hoc analysis to compare capture site type and oiling classifications (using the SAS Multtest procedure). Because of a limited range of severity of visible oiling (Table 1), we classified birds for statistical models as either birds from reference sites, birds from areas of potential impact with visible oil, or birds from areas of potential impact with no visible oil. These 3 categories were used in all blood analyses.\u000a\u000aRESULTS In reference areas, the only birds with any oiling were 7 great egrets with trace quantities of visible oiling. We retained these birds in their a priori designated reference group for our statistical analyses and were thus conservative in our analysis. In areas of potential impact, we found numerous birds with trace and light oiling, but we captured no birds that were moderately or heavily visibly oiled (Table 1). Visible oiling of birds captured from areas of potential impact ranged in frequency from 25% in brown pelicans to 75% in American oystercatchers. In birds captured from reference areas, we found significant differences among species for reticulocytes, red blood cell count, ferritin, packed cell volume, hemoglobin, and mean cell volume (Tables 2 and 3). In birds captured from areas of potential impact sites, we found significant differences among species for all endpoints (Tables 2 and 3). Table 2.

Post hoc analyses revealed that black skimmers both with and without visible oiling from areas of potential impact (p = 0.019 and p = 0.013 respectively) and brown pelicans both with and without visible oiling (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively) had significantly greater numbers of reticulocytes than birds from reference sites. Oiled American oystercatchers (p < 0.001) and great egrets (p = 0.004) had significantly greater numbers of reticulocytes than birds from reference sites, whereas neither differed from birds without visible oil from areas of potential impact.

AMOY = American oystercatcher; API = area of potential impact; BLSK = black skimmer; BRPE = brown pelican; GREG = great egret. Birds from areas of potential impact also had lower hemoglobin concentration than birds from reference sites (Figure 5). We found significant differences in hemoglobin concentrations in brown pelicans (p = 0.002) and great egrets (p < 0.001) but not black skimmers (p = 0.876). Hemoglobin was not determined in American oystercatchers from area of potential impact sites, and thus, this species was excluded from analysis. Post hoc analyses revealed that brown pelicans with and without visible oiling (p=0.01 and p=0.003, respectively) from areas of potential impact had significantly lower hemoglobin concentrations than reference birds. Similarly, great egrets with and without visible oiling (p=0.003 and p=0.001, respectively) from areas of potential impact had significantly lower hemoglobin concentrations than birds from reference sites. Across species, birds from areas of potential impact great egrets with and without visible oiling (p=0.003 and p=0.001, respectively) from areas of potential impact averaged 8% lower hemoglobin than birds from reference sites. However, we found no statistically significant difference in mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration between birds from areas of potential impact and reference sites. Figure 5.

Although red blood cell count did not differ statistically in black skimmers and brown pelicans, great egrets from areas of potential impact had lower red blood cell count counts (p = 0.003) than birds from reference sites (Figure 6). Post hoc analyses revealed that great egrets from reference areas had significantly greater (16%) red blood cell count than birds from areas of potential impact with no visible oiling (p = 0.006) and marginally greater (9%) red blood cell count than birds from areas of potential impact with visible oil (p = 0.05).

Although mean cell volume did not differ in black skimmers, we found a significant difference between sites in brown pelicans (p < 0.001) and great egrets (p < 0.001). Post hoc analyses revealed that brown pelicans from areas of potential impact with and without visible oiling had smaller mean cell volume than reference birds (p < 0.001), whereas great egrets from areas of potential impact with visible oil had lower mean cell volume (p < 0.001) and those without visible oil had marginally smaller mean cell volume than birds from reference sites (p = 0.035). The mean cell volume was not determined in American oystercatchers, and thus, this species was excluded from analysis. We found no significant relationship between visible oiling and haptoglobin-like protein concentration in American oystercatchers, brown pelicans, or great egrets. However, in black skimmers we found a marginally significant difference in haptoglobin-like protein concentration (p = 0.014). Black skimmers from areas of potential impact with no visible oil had lower haptoglobin-like protein concentrations than those from reference sites (p = 0.008). We found no significant relationship between visible oiling and ferritin concentration in American oystercatchers, black skimmers, or brown pelicans. However, we found a significant difference among sites in ferritin concentration in response to visible oiling in great egrets (p < 0.001). Post hoc analyses revealed that great egrets from reference areas had significantly higher ferritin than birds from areas of potential impact with visible oiling (p < 0.001) and without visible oiling (p < 0.001).\u000a\u000aDISCUSSION The Deepwater Horizon spill released an unprecedented volume of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico [24]. Although there were thousands of dead birds found in the weeks following the disaster, there were many more that were likely exposed to oil that suffered sublethal injury [3]. We demonstrated in the present study that even birds with small amounts of oil present on their feathers can experience oxidative injury to erythrocytes, can have decreased numbers of circulating erythrocytes (packed cell volume), and can show evidence of a regenerative hematological response (i.e., increased reticulocytes; Table 4). We also found hematological injury in birds from areas of potential impact without visible evidence of oiling when compared with reference birds. This finding is important because it suggests that birds present in the areas of potential impact were experiencing oxidative injury even without visible evidence of oil exposure. Although oil that was previously present on the feathers may have been preened and ingested, oil exposure can also occur from drinking and foraging on contaminated prey. A variety of adverse effects of oil ingestion without external oiling have been reported in numerous experimental studies [9, 11, 18, 20]. Together these findings provide strong evidence that relatively modest oil exposure may cause hematologic injury in coastal and marine birds. Table 4.

Further, this oxidative injury was either the result of recent onset or was ongoing because cells with Heinz bodies undergo lysis and are rapidly removed from the circulation [27]. Conversely, in all of the individual birds from the reference sites (n = 157) we found only a single bird with Heinz bodies present, indicating that oxidative injury that causes Heinz body formation is quite uncommon in unexposed populations of these 4 species. Such low background occurrence of Heinz bodies in unexposed populations makes this an attractive cellular response variable for field studies in these species. Avian erythrocytes often contain retained reticular material that has affinity for new methylene blue stain. Some authors have found it difficult to distinguish Heinz bodies from retained reticular material in nestling birds because very young birds have an abundance of immature cells containing large amounts of this reticulum [20]. Although the birds we sampled represented a variety of age classes, none were nestlings. It is likely that light microscopy may underestimate the number of cells affected by oxidative injury because not all cells that have undergone oxidative insult will develop Heinz body inclusions, and the button-shaped changes that are apparent in mammalian erythrocytes are absent in avian erythrocytes [20, 33]. When possible, electron microscopy may provide a more sensitive and complementary screening tool for oxidative injury to erythrocytes because it can identify additional ultrastructural changes to cells that may be overlooked by light microscopy such as damaged mitochondria and disruption of nuclear membranes [33, 34]. Oxidative injury to erythrocytes is expected to result in a reduction in packed cell volume or red blood cell count and a subsequent regenerative response that includes an increase in reticulocytes. We found the presence of Heinz bodies, increased reticulocytes, and decreased packed cell volume in American oystercatchers, brown pelicans, and great egrets from impacted sites. This cascade can cause a decrease in oxygen availability to tissues, which can subsequently induce muscle fatigue, lethargy, decreased energy availability for metabolic processes, and adverse reproductive impacts and ultimately may have implications for survival and fitness [16, 18, 35, 36]. The present results indicate that there are species-specific differences in our target variables within both reference sites and areas of potential impact, highlighting the importance of species considerations when evaluating effects of oiling on avian physiology (Table 2) [37, 38]. In addition to inherent physiological variation among species, differences in foraging strategies, habitat preferences, and behaviors may play a role in differences in both exposure and effects among species. For example, we found that the great egret was the only species with reference individuals that had evidence of visible oiling (n = 7 out of 48; Table 1). Among species in the present study, great egrets are most apt to frequently forage in drainage ponds and in pooled, standing water from residential or industrial runoff, which may contain petroleum waste. Therefore, individuals of this species may be at higher risk for exposure to petroleum from other sources than other species examined in the present investigation. Ferritin and haptoglobin-like protein have been suggested to be markers for oxidative injury from crude oil exposure [23]. However, the documentation for the relationship between haptoglobin-like protein and oil exposure is inconsistent and based on exposure to large amounts of oil [23, 29]. We found only marginally lower haptoglobin-like protein in black skimmers from areas of potential impact than reference birds and a trend toward decreased haptoglobin-like protein in oiled individuals of all species when compared with birds from reference sites. Levels of haptoglobin-like protein have been shown to vary widely in both reference and exposed individuals, and differences have been described among age classes [29]. In addition, circulating haptoglobin-like protein is known to increase in response to inflammation [39]. Therefore, it is possible that oil-induced inflammation increases circulating haptoglobin-like protein, whereas hemolysis consumes haptoglobin-like protein, leading to a limited net effect. We found that ferritin was related to oil exposure only in great egrets (lower in birds from areas of potential impact than reference birds) and not in the other species. This result contrasts with previous work that suggested that ferritin may be elevated in birds exposed to oil to protect against oxidation of biomolecules [23]. Ferritin concentration in the serum can be affected by a number of environmental factors. It functions primarily to store iron, but it also operates to quench free radicals, such as hydrogen peroxide, and serves as an acute-phase inflammatory protein. Moreover, ferritin has been found to vary by age and species [40]. In humans, serum ferritin has been found to vary by diet, activity level, and reticulocyte percentage because erythropoietin-stimulated red blood cell count production can reduce serum ferritin concentration [41-43]. Finally, a large proportion of ferritin within the body is found within cells, not in plasma where it has been historically measured in wild birds [7, 23, 29, 44]. Taken together, the present results suggest that ferritin and haptoglobin-like protein may not be useful as specific biomarkers of trace and light oil exposure, in contrast to their apparent utility in heavily oiled birds [23]. Mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration are values that can be used to help determine if anemia is regenerative (e.g., from hemolysis) or nonregenerative (e.g., chronic disease). Birds with hemolytic anemia have increased reticulocyte counts, which can often manifest with increased mean cell volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, because young red blood cells tend to be larger (i.e., increased mean cell volume) and during hemolysis there can be artifactually elevated mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration attributable to increased free hemoglobin in the bloodstream. In the present study, we found that mean cell volume did not differ between areas of potential impact and reference sites. These results may have occurred because although packed cell volume was determined in a field laboratory shortly after collection, red blood cell count was determined approximately 48 h postcollection. The time delay from collection to red blood cell count determination may have resulted in a small amount of evaporation of plasma, leading to an artifactually higher red blood cell count compared with packed cell volume values [16]. Consequently, because mean cell volume is the result of packed cell volume/red blood cell count, an artifactually elevated red blood cell count would cause a relative decrease in mean cell volume. Further, although mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration was higher in all species of birds from areas of potential impact than birds from reference sites, the results were not statistically significant. It is also possible that chronic inflammation from ongoing crude oil exposure may have confounded these results because chronic inflammation can contribute to reduced mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration [16]. Although circulating PAH concentrations may be important for identifying recent exposure and understanding doseresponse relationships, the methodology for quantifying blood PAH levels is time-consuming, expensive, and not always practical in field studies, particularly if large sample sizes are desirable or funding is limited. During oil spill events external visible oiling can be determined quickly and inexpensively following only minimal personnel training. We demonstrated in the present study that trace and light visible oiling are correlated with adverse effects that include oxidative hemolysis and decreased packed cell volume. Therefore, visible oiling represents a relatively cost- and time-effective strategy for assessing sublethal exposure under rapid response scenarios in the field and should be emphasized as a key component in future oil spill events. In summary, the present results demonstrated that birds exposed to oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill had evidence of oxidative injury to erythrocytes, decreased numbers of erythrocytes in the circulation, and evidence of an erythrocytic regenerative response. These changes are consistent with oxidative hemolytic anemia caused by exposure to oil. The pathologic implications of Heinz body formation and its relationship to petroleum exposure make this an important endpoint for health assessments following oil spill events because Heinz body formation in birds is a pathological abnormality. In wild bird populations, anemia has been associated with decreased survival and has been linked to increased stress and immunosuppression as well as decreased reproductive success [45-47]. These repercussions of anemia have obvious implications for individual fitness and suggest that sublethal physiological injury associated with small amounts of oil exposure may have important negative long-term repercussions for individuals. In addition, the present study demonstrates that proper new methylene blue staining to enumerate reticulocytes and erythrocytic inclusions consistent with Heinz bodies is an important technique that can be applied under field conditions during petroleum-associated wildlife incidents [17].\u000a\u000aAcknowledgment We thank P.
