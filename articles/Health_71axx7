VSubjects and samples\u000a\u000aSubjects in the discovery and replication stages with alcohol dependence or abuse will be referred to as AUD.\u000a\u000aDiscovery stage genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in brain\u000a\u000aMethylomic profiling\u000a\u000aWe used a stepwise, multiple-level approach across various tissue types and outcome for the initial discovery analysis. A graphic representation is shown in Figures 1ac.\u000a\u000aMethylomic profiling discovery data set of postmortem prefrontal cortex tissue: Bulk brain derived DNA methylation profiles generated on Illumina Human Methylation 450 (HM450) bead chip microarrays from 46 postmortem prefrontal cortex (PFC) samples were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus from GSE49393. The sample was comprised of 23 subjects with AUD (16 males and 7 females) and 23 age-matched healthy controls. Detailed methodology and sample description can be found elsewhere.13 Fresh-frozen sections of Brodmann area 9 (BA9, mainly the dorsolateral PFC of the brain) postmortem brain tissues were obtained from the New South Wales Tissue Resource Centre (NSW TRC) at the University of Sydney and ethic approval was obtained from the Sydney Local Health Network and the University of Sydney. For each probe on the microarray, a linear model was performed to determine the association of DNA methylation with alcohol relative to control status, controlling for age, sex and neuronal proportion as estimated by the Cell EpigenoType Specific (CETS) algorithm.14 For this analysis, alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence were grouped together for case status. Correction for multiple testing was assessed using the False Discovery Rate method. Detailed sample demographics appear in Supplementary Table S1.\u000a\u000aNeuronal and non-neuronal postmortem prefrontal cortical tissue National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) brain bank sample: Postmortem cortical tissue from major depressive disorder (MDD; n=29) and matched control (n=29) samples were obtained from the NICHD brain bank and DNA methylation profiles using HM450 arrays from FACs isolated neuronal and non-neuronal (glial) nuclei were obtained as previously described.14 For the neuronal and glial fractions separately, a linear model was performed to determine the association of DNA methylation with alcohol relative to control status, controlling for age, sex and postmortem interval for each probe on the microarray. Alcohol case status was based on reported alcohol abuse in the summary of health history provided by the NICHD brain bank. Correction for multiple testing was assessed using the false discovery rate method. Detailed sample demographics appear in Supplementary Table S2.\u000a\u000aNational Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) methylomic profiling discovery data set with resting-state magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) functional connectivity (FC): A total of 68 right-handed individuals with a diagnosis of AUD and 72 healthy controls were recruited to the NIAAA at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), USA. Written informed consent to the study was obtained from all the subjects, which was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the NIAAA and was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the NIH Combined Neuroscience IRB. Participants were compensated for their time. Blood was obtained from the 68 individuals with a diagnosis of AUD.\u000a\u000aThe Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID)15 was administered to all participants. A smoking questionnaire helped to determine the amount and frequency of a participants cigarette use. The Alcohol Dependence Scale (ADS) was administered to determine the severity of alcohol dependence (AD).16 Exclusionary criteria included pregnancy, claustrophobia, and significant neurological or medical diagnoses. Participants were instructed not to consume any alcohol for 24 h and no more than half a cup of caffeinated beverages 12 h prior to each scanning visit. Participants could not participate if they had a positive alcohol breathalyzer or positive urine drug screen on the day of the scan. Controls were excluded if they met criteria for any current or past alcohol dependence. All subjects were required to be deemed physically healthy by a clinician. At the time of the MRI, AD participants could not be exhibiting severe symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, as determined by the Clinical Institutes Withdrawal Assessment-Alcohol revised (CIWA-Ar) score of >8.17 Detailed sample demographics appear in Supplementary Table S3.\u000a\u000aMRI data acquisition and pre-processing\u000a\u000aWhole-brain anatomical images and 5 min of closed-eyes resting-state fMRI were collected using 3 T General Electric and 3 T SIEMENS MRI scanners. High-resolution T1-weighted 3D structural scans were acquired for each subject using an MPRAGE sequence (128 axial slices, TR=1200 ms TE=30 ms, 256  256 matrix). Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) datasets were collected using a single-shot gradient echo planar imaging pulse sequence with 36 axial slices acquired parallel to the anterior/posterior commissural line (TR=2000 ms, TE=30 ms, flip angle=90, 3.75 mm  3.75 mm  3.8 mm voxels).\u000a\u000ars-fMRI data pre-processing\u000a\u000aUsing Functional MRI of the Brain (FMRIB)s Software Library (www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl) we applied; (1) slice timing correction for interleaved acquisitions using Sinc interpolation with a Hanning windowing kernel; (2) motion correction using FMRIBs Linear Image Registration Tool;18 (3) non-brain removal using Brain Extraction Tool;19 (4) spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel of full width at half maximum 5mm; (5) grandmean intensity normalization of the entire 4D data set by a single multiplicative factor, the size of the voxels is 4  4  4 mm3; (6) high-pass temporal filtering (Gaussian-weighted least-squares straight line fitting, with sigma=50 s); and (7) registration to high-resolution structural MNI standard space images using the FMRIBs Linear Image Registration Tool.18, 20\u000a\u000ars-fMRI connectivity analysis\u000a\u000aWe applied Probabilistic Independent Component Analysis (PICA)21 by using the Multivariate Exploratory Linear Decomposition into Independent Components (MELODIC) toolbox of the FSL package.\u000a\u000aA temporal concatenation tool in MELODIC was used to derive group level components across all subjects. Pre-processed data were whitened and projected into a 36-dimensional subspace using PICA where the number of dimensions was estimated using the Laplace approximation to the Bayesian evidence of the model order.21 The whitened observations were decomposed into sets of vectors, which describe signal variation across the temporal domain (time-courses) and across the spatial domain (maps) by optimizing for non-Gaussian spatial source distributions using a fixed-point iteration technique.22 These FC components maps were standardized into z statistic images via a normalized mixture model fit (thresholded at z>7).21 Two criteria were used to remove biologically irrelevant components: (1) those representing known artifacts such as motion, and high-frequency noise; and (2) those with connectivity patterns not located mainly in gray matter. Networks of interest were identified as anatomically and functionally classical resting state networks23 upon visual inspection.\u000a\u000aThe between-subject analysis was carried out using dual regression, a regression technique which back-reconstructs each group level component map at the individual subject level. Next, a non-parametric permutation test (FSLs randomize tool, with 5000 permutations), that utilizes a threshold-free cluster enhanced (TFCE) thresholding, was used to assess statistically significant differences in FC between the groups. To minimize the potential confounding influence of age, gender, ancestry informative marker (AIM) scores and scanner types in these results, these parameters were used as nuisance covariates for each network of interest. Finally, the resulting statistical maps were thresholded at P<0.05 family-wise error corrected for the main group effect. The Harvard-Oxford cortical and subcortical atlases incorporated in FSL were used to identify the anatomical regions of the resulting PICA maps. The FSL Cluster tools were used to report information about clusters in the selected maps. The functional connectivity maps were overlaid onto the mean standardized structural T1 1-mm MNI template and visualized using Mricrogl.\u000a\u000aPeripheral blood Illumina HM450 data processing\u000a\u000aFollowing removal of three subject samples with failed bisulfite conversion, raw Illumina HM450 microarray data was processed using the wateRmelon package in R.24 Raw data was trimmed of probes failing quality assessment and a known list of 32 323 cross-reactive probes,25 followed by scale-based data correction for Illumina type I relative to type II probes. Methylated and unmethylated intensity values were then quantile normalized separately prior to the calculation of the  value based on the following definition:\u000a\u000a value=(signal intensity of methylation-detection probe)/(signal intensity of methylation- detection probesignal intensity of non-methylation-detection probe100).\u000a\u000aValues were then adjusted by taking the residuals of a linear model of -values as a function of sodium bisulfite modification batch.\u000a\u000aPCSK9 targeted replication\u000a\u000aGrady Trauma Project blood replication sample\u000a\u000aThe subjects for this study were part of a larger investigation of genetic and environmental factors that predict response to stressful life events in a predominantly African American, urban population of low socioeconomic status.26, 27, 28 Research participants were approached in the waiting rooms of primary care clinics of a large, public hospital while either waiting for their medical appointments or waiting with others who were scheduled for medical appointments. After the subjects provided written informed consent, they participated in a verbal interview and blood draw. This cohort was characterized by high rates of interpersonal violence and psychosocial stress; the majority of subjects reported at least one major trauma during their lifetime, and the number of traumatic experiences in childhood and adulthood predicted psychiatric symptom severity in adulthood.28, 29 DNA methylation profiles from n=392 African American individuals were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus from GSE72680. Detailed sample demographics appear in Supplementary Table S5.\u000a\u000aNIAAA blood samples of individuals with AUD for targeted plasma replication\u000a\u000aSubjects (n=90) with a diagnosis of alcohol dependence according to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV15 were recruited at the NIAAA alcohol treatment program. Participants were between 21 and 65 years old. Informed consent was obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\u000a\u000aMost of the alcohol-dependent participants were recruited through local newspaper advertisements for the alcohol treatment program at the NIAAA at the NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA. The participants consisted of men and women from a broad range of socioeconomic backgrounds ranging from executives to unemployed individuals. Participants underwent extensive clinical and physical examinations. Participants with a history of seizures, head trauma (defined as a period of unconsciousness exceeding 1 h), or medical conditions requiring chronic medications were excluded from participation. Participants were literate in English and were not suffering from active psychotic symptoms or severe cognitive impairment. Participants were voluntarily admitted to the NIAAA inpatient unit in the NIH Clinical Center between February 2010 and May 2014. Once they were admitted, participants were detoxified from alcohol and participated in the alcohol treatment program.\u000a\u000aDetailed sample demographics appear in Supplementary Table S6. Blood and plasma samples were obtained and DNA extracted using standard methods. Plasma samples were obtained from two IRB approved protocols. All the bloods were drawn around 0800 hours after overnight bed rest. Participants were nil per os (NPO) for ~10 h prior to blood collection. Blood was collected in prechilled EDTA tubes which were promptly put into wet ice and taken to the laboratory to be processed. Samples were spun in a 4 C centrifuge (Beckman-Coulter Allegra X-12R) at 1880 g for 10 min; the plasma was then aliquoted into NUNC cyrovials and frozen at 80 C until assayed.\u000a\u000aThe first set of samples (n=55) were alcohol treatment-seeking inpatient participants. Their blood samples were drawn after alcohol withdrawal within 5 days of their last drink of alcohol.\u000a\u000aThe second set of samples (n=35) were alcohol treatment-seeking inpatients who were also diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. After alcohol withdrawal and withdrawal from any other medications for up to 14 days after a participant's last drink, the participants blood samples were drawn.\u000a\u000aIn both sample sets, average drinks per day, drinking days, and heavy drinking days were recorded for the 90 days prior to inpatient admission using the Timeline Followback Questionnaire.30 ADS was also assessed; this score can range from 0 to 47 and scores greater than 27 are classified as substantial or severe AUD. Detailed sample demographics appear in Supplementary Table S6. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides and total bilirubin were measured using standard procedures in mg d/l. Gamma-Glutamyltransferase (GGT) was measured using standard procedures in U/l. Samples were collected on the date of admission to the NIAAA treatment program and processed by the NIH Clinical Center Department of Laboratory Medicine.\u000a\u000aPCSK9 protein concentrations were determined in 90 subjects with AUD using Luminex technology (Luminex, Austin, TX, USA). A Human Magnetic Luminex Screening Assay was performed per the manufacturers instructions (catalogue #LXSAHM, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), with plasma dilutions of 1:5. Data were analyzed using Milliplex Analyst software (EMD Millipore Corporation, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).\u000a\u000aSamples were assayed in duplicates. Mean CV for all 90 samples was 2.622.39 (means.d.). Samples were randomized across four 96-well plates, and CV for two quality-control samples run on all four plates were 0.069 and 0.065, respectively.\u000a\u000aNIAAA AUD and healthy control blood samples for targeted pyrosequencing replication\u000a\u000aBlood was obtained from 62 healthy controls that participated in studies at NIAAA as previously described.13 Detailed sample demographics appear in Supplementary Table S6. Pyrosequencing was performed as detailed for these NIAAA healthy controls and 90 AUD subjects used in the plasma experiment described above.\u000a\u000aPyrosequencing was performed following techniques described by Kaminsky et al.31 Sodium bisulfite conversion was carried out using EZ DNA Methylation Gold Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) according to the manufacturers instructions on 500 ng of DNA from tested human tissues. Nested PCR amplifications were performed with a standard PCR protocol in 25 l volume reactions containing 34 l of sodium-bisulfite-treated DNA, 0.2 M primers, and master mix containing Taq DNA polymerase (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Primer annealing temperatures for the outside and inside nested PCR were 58.6 and 61.9C, respectively. Outside primer sequences were as follows:\u000a\u000aForward primer 5-AGTAGTTAGTTGGTAAGGTTAGT-3, Reverse primer 5-ACCTTTTCAATATTTCCTAAATCCA-3, Inside primer sequences were as follows: Forward primer 5-GGTTAAGTTTAGAAGGTTGTTAGGT-3, Reverse primer 5-CCACCTTATCTCCTACTAACCAA-3 with a biotin modification on the 5 end. PCR amplicons were processed for pyrosequencing analysis per the manufacturers standard protocol (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) using a PyroMark MD system (Qiagen) with Pyro Q-CpG 1.0.9 software (Qiagen) for CpG methylation quantification. The pyrosequencing primer sequence was 5-AGGTTAAGGTTAGTGGAAAGAAT-3. Only data passing internal quality checks for sodium bisulfite conversion efficiency, signal to noise ratio, and the observed vs. expected match of the predicted pyrogram peak profile using reference peaks were incorporated in subsequent analyses. Data generated derive from one technical replicate.\u000a\u000aUniversity of Minnesota Liver Tissue Cell Distribution System liver samples\u000a\u000aNormal human liver and pathologic human liver were obtained through the Liver Tissue Cell Distribution System (LTCDS) (Minneapolis, MN, USA), which was funded by NIH Contract #HSN276200017C. The LTCDS is an NIH service contract to provide human liver tissue from regional centers to scientific investigators. These regional centers have active liver transplant programs. Human subject approval was obtained to provide portions of the resected livers for which the transplant was performed. We obtained liver tissue from transplant candidates with alcoholic cirrhosis (n=50) and healthy controls (n=50). Detailed sample demographics appear in Supplementary Table S7.\u000a\u000aLTCDS human liver Illumina EPIC data processing\u000a\u000aFrom the LTCDS data set, 2 control and 2 liver transplant tissues were excluded due to space limitations on the array. The remaining human alcohol-induced cirrhotic liver transplant tissues (n=48) and controls (n=48) were subjected to Illumina Methylation EPIC DNA methylation microarray analysis. Normalization of binary format.idat files for red and green channel intensities was carried out in R. Initial background correction was performed using the minfi R-package32 followed by individual red and green channel quantile normalization using the dasen method in wateRmelon.24 After normalization, the beta value () was used to estimate the methylation level of each CpG locus using the ratio of intensities between methylated and unmethylated alleles (M/M+U=100) where M and U represent the methylated and unmethylated intensities respectively.33\u000a\u000aLTCDS-targeted pyrosequencing replication methods\u000a\u000aDNA purification and extraction: DNA was extracted using a Maxwell Tissue Purification Kit with a Promega Maxwell 16 Forensic Instrument (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). DNA extraction was performed according to manufacturers instructions. DNA concentrations were verified to be of adequate concentration (>95 ng l1).\u000a\u000aReal-time quantitative PCR\u000a\u000aRNA was extracted using an Ambion Ribopure RNA Purification Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockville, MD, USA) according to the manufacturers instructions. One microgram total RNA was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT-PCR kit (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA). Real-time quantitative PCR was run in ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System with Using TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Thermo Fisher). Gene expression was studied with TaqMan PCR assays (PCSK9; Hs00545399_m1). 18S gene was used as an endogenous control. Data were analyzed initially using ViiA 7 Software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Gene expression was analyzed in liver tissue from transplant candidates with alcoholic cirrhosis (n=24) and healthy controls (n=24). The data analysis was performed using GraphPad prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).\u000a\u000aSodium bisulfite pyrosequencing\u000a\u000aPyrosequencing was performed as detailed above. Methylation data was excluded for three healthy control samples due to experimental error (n=47).\u000a\u000aUniversity of Florida liver sample\u000a\u000aThe samples used in this analysis were derived from cirrhotic (n=66) and normal liver (n=34) tissues from the University of Florida Shands Hospital by surgical resection as reported previously by Hlady et al.34 Normal livers were derived from surgical patients for benign liver lesions. Data were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus from GSE60753. Sample demographics appear in Supplementary Table S8.\u000a\u000aTranslational animal models\u000a\u000aMouse model\u000a\u000aMouse brain, blood and liver tissues were analyzed for methylation, mRNA and protein expression using standard methodologies. Tissue was derived from mice that underwent the NIAAA model of chronic and binge ethanol feeding. Briefly, this model uses 10 days ad libitum oral feeding of the Lieber-DeCarli ethanol liquid diet plus a single-binge ethanol feeding. Samples were collected 8 h after the single-binge feeding. Detailed information can be found elsewhere.35 DNA of tissues was extracted using the Maxwell Tissue Purification Kit as described above.\u000a\u000aReal-time quantitative PCR\u000a\u000aTotal RNA was extracted using an RNeasy mini-kit (Qiagen). One microgram total RNA was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). Real-time quantitative PCR was run in ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System with Using TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Thermo Fisher). Gene expression was studied with TaqMan PCR assays (PCSK9; Mm01263610_m1). We used 18S gene as an endogenous control. Data were analyzed initially using ViiA 7 Software (Applied Biosystems). The data analysis was performed using GraphPad prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software).\u000a\u000aWestern blot analysis\u000a\u000aLiver homogenates were prepared in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris; 1% NP40; 0.25% deoxycholic acid sodium salt; 150 mM NaCl; 1 mM EGTA) containing 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The protein concentrations were quantified using a detergent-compatible protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufacturers instructions. Aliquots of 50 g of protein extract were denatured in Laemmli buffer containing 5% -mercaptoethanol, and the samples were loaded and separated by gel electrophoresis on a 7% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen). Samples were incubated with a primary antibody at 4 C overnight under shaking conditions. Immunoreactive bands were visualized on nitrocellulose membranes using alkaline-phosphatase-linked anti-rabbit antibodies and the ECF detection system with a PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Anti-PCSK9 antibody (ab125251) and beta-actin were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA).\u000a\u000aRat model\u000a\u000aAdult male Wistar rats (Charles River) received pre-vapor operant conditioning for 3 weeks and were first trained to self-administer alcohol using a modified sucrose-fading procedure in which 10% ethanol was added to a sweet solution. Sweeteners were gradually removed from the solution. Upon completion, animals could self-administer alcohol (10% ethanol and water solution) on a schedule of reinforcement. The case rats were then treated with a chronic intermittent exposure to alcohol in vapor chambers. Ethanol exposure lasted 14 h and was followed by 10 h off. During exposure, blood alcohol levels ranged between 150 and 250 mg%. This cycle was repeated for 20 days. Nondependent rats were not exposed to alcohol vapor.\u000a\u000aDNA purification and extraction\u000a\u000aDNA was extracted using a Maxwell Tissue Purification Kit as described above.\u000a\u000aReal-time quantitative PCR\u000a\u000aRNA was extracted using an Ambion Ribopure RNA Purification Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturers instructions.
