VJump to Section Methods Study Design and Population Metabolic Assessments Tracer/Feeding Study Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy Outpatient Feeding and Follow-up De Novo Lipogenesis and Insulin Kinetics Statistical Analyses Results Participants Magnetic Resonance Measures De Novo Lipogenesis and Insulin Kinetics Comparison of Subjects Based on Baseline Liver Fat Content Discussion Acknowledgments References\u000a\u000aIn the past 2 decades, the prevalence of NAFLD has more than doubled in adolescents31 and adults,32 with current estimates as high as 50% in the United States.33 Hepatic steatosis, as well as other ectopic fat stores, are implicated in obesity-related metabolic dysfunction that occurs in adolescents34 and adults12 and includes insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.7, 8, 35, 36, 37, 38 Multiple cross-sectional studies have linked liver fat and VAT with metabolic complications of obesity, including insulin resistance, T2DM, and cardiovascular disease.6, 9, 10, 36, 38 Fabbrini et al,10 using sensitive metabolic assessments, found that liver fat was more strongly associated with insulin resistance than was VAT. In this study, we demonstrate that as few as 9 days of isocaloric fructose restriction significantly reduced liver fat, DNL, and VAT, and improved insulin sensitivity, secretion, and clearance in children with obesity and metabolic syndrome. The improvements in these outcome measures occurred irrespective of baseline liver fat content, sex, or race/ethnicity.\u000a\u000aOthers have noted that both reduction in glycemic index/load improves liver fat and metabolic function in adolescents with NAFLD.39 Rather, our study demonstrates that isocaloric substitution of starch for sugar, which has the end effect of increasing glycemic index, improved liver and visceral fat and insulin secretion and sensitivity within 10 days. Our data suggest that the effect of fructose on liver fat is specific and mediated through reductions in DNL.\u000a\u000aDNL was originally thought to be a minor metabolic pathway in humans.25 However, increased DNL has been demonstrated in adults with NAFLD.35 Using stable isotopes, Donnelly et al8 showed that in adults with NAFLD, approximately 59% of triglyceride labeled in the liver comes from circulating fatty acids released by peripheral lipolysis, 15% from dietary fat, and 26% from DNL. If fatty acid influx is not matched by hepatic fat oxidation and export, liver fat will accumulate. DNL impacts both sides of this equation, both by generating new lipids and by suppressing hepatic fat oxidation, as the intermediate malonyl-CoA prevents fatty acid transport into mitochondria by inhibiting carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1.40 Fructose consumption has been proposed as a primary contributor to NAFLD4, 41 by increasing DNL. We have recently shown that in healthy adults fed isocaloric diets, DNL and liver fat were higher during high-fructose feeding when compared with low-fructose feeding.18 Those results, taken together with those of the present study, support the hypothesis that DNL is an important mechanism in the modulation of liver fat.8, 35, 42 In addition, the increases in VAT with high-fructose feeding2 and the decrease in VAT observed with fructose restriction observed in the present study suggest primary links between fructose consumption, DNL, and ectopic fat. The decline of fractional DNL after 9 days of fructose restriction suggests that the process of DNL is a rational target for dietary intervention.\u000a\u000aAlthough study eligibility was not based on liver fat content, 63% of our participants had high liver fat. Consistent with other reports,43 high liver fat was significantly more prevalent in Latino children compared with African Americans. However, even with a habitual diet high in fructose, 37% of the children appeared to be protected against NAFLD. On day 0, the subgroup of children with low liver fat had significantly lower fasting insulin levels and higher CISI than those with high liver fat (Table 1Table 1). After fructose restriction (day 10), fasting insulin levels remained significantly higher in the group with high liver fat (P = .002), despite improvements in insulin sensitivity, secretion, and clearance. We noted that both insulin secretion and clearance improved with reduction in liver fat and postprandial DNL after fructose restriction, despite calorically equivalent increases in starch consumption. We have previously shown that persons with hyperinsulinemia have high fasting DNL compared with normoinsulinemic controls.44, 45, 46 A key role of hepatic insulin signaling in stimulating DNL has been reported.47, 48 Consistent with these observations, the children with high liver fat, who also had elevated fasting insulin levels, may also have had higher DNL even before feeding. These children likely had around-the-clock DNL driven by fructose in the fed state and by hyperinsulinemia in the fasting state, thus providing a potential explanation for why some obese children have elevated liver fat and others do not. Further studies are necessary to test this hypothesis and to characterize the impact of genetic factors on liver fat.\u000a\u000aIn this article, we document improvements in liver fat, DNL, insulin kinetics, and, to a lesser extent, VAT in obese children when sugar in the diet is replaced with starch; that is, a glucose-for-fructose exchange. Liver and visceral fat are thought to play a prominent role in metabolic dysfunction.6, 7, 12 Previously published results from our study demonstrated reductions in blood pressure and levels of analytes related to prediabetes (eg, lactate, glucose, and insulin).19 In addition, we reported improvement in lipoprotein profiles related to atherogenicity (eg, triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein ratio, low-density lipoprotein size, and Apo-CIII concentration).20 All of these measures were performed in the fasting state, thus the improvements in metabolic function cannot be attributed to acute effect of fructose reduction in the liquid meals during the tracer feeding study on day 10. The improvements in metabolic, lipid, and ectopic fat parameters were accompanied by changes in homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and CISI, 2 measures of peripheral insulin sensitivity. By demonstrating that removal of dietary fructose (the macronutrient most closely associated with hepatic DNL) concomitantly reduces liver fat and improves insulin dynamics irrespective of calories or weight, we are able to suggest a causative mechanism of metabolic dysfunction in these children by linking DNL to both liver fat and insulin resistance. We also demonstrated that despite an increase in the glucose (starch) content of the diet, insulin secretion decreased, thus protecting against -cell exhaustion, thought to be important in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes7; and reducing total body insulin burden, thought to contribute to both obesity49 and risk for cardiovascular disease.50 These data also suggest an achievable dietary approach to improve metabolic dysfunction in similarly affected children who are high sugar consumers.\u000a\u000aWe note the following limitations of this study. First, the study design did not include a separate external control group. However, including such a control group would have introduced new challenges. For example, studies document that dietary sugar intake by recall is consistently underestimated.51 Had we included an external control group, it is unlikely that we could have accurately matched their true baseline sugar intake, thus raising the possibility of over- or under-feeding sugar to the control group and potentially providing flawed results. Instead, each participant served as his/her own control, which minimized inter-participant variability. Future confirmatory studies should include a control group with specified and monitored fructose intake both before and during the experimental diet. Second, despite efforts to maintain baseline weight, overall there was a small but statistically significant weight loss (0.9 kg; 95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 0.6). While small reductions in weight could improve metabolic health,29 we do not believe that the salutary weight loss in these subjects mitigates our findings related to reductions in liver fat and DNL. As discussed previously,19, 20 the weight loss occurred within the first 4 days and then plateaued to reach a new steady state. This result is not consistent with persistent energy deficit at the day-10 visit. As reported previously,19 dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scanning documented that the weight loss occurred within the fat-free compartment (eg, water and/or muscle), the loss of either of which would not contribute substantially to improved metabolic health. In addition, the results remained statistically significant after adjusting for this weight loss using repeated measures analysis of covariance. We would be remiss in not acknowledging the possibility that slight changes in macronutrient or fiber content in the fructose-restricted diets19 may have been more satiating than their home baseline diet, which posed a challenge to the study coordinator to persuade participants to increase intake past comfort. Perhaps most importantly, sensitivity analysis documented statistically significant improvements in DNL, liver fat, and VAT in the subgroup of participants who did not lose weight (Figures 2Figures 2EH and 33C and 33D). Third, we did not measure DNL in the fasting state. While such a steady-state measurement would have yielded important information about genetic predisposition toward NAFLD and the existence of around-the-clock DNL in susceptible populations, doing so would have required changing from an outpatient to an inpatient protocol, which would have limited recruitment and retention of pediatric participants, which was already quite demanding. Lastly, we acknowledge that our study design does not allow us to speculate on benefits of fructose restriction in normal-weight children or adults, or extrapolate our results to obese individuals whose diets are low in fructose content.\u000a\u000aTo date, small non-randomized studies in obese children have shown improvements in liver histology and aminotransferase activity after weight loss.52, 53 Rather, in this study, we demonstrate that as few as 9 days of isocaloric fructose restriction significantly reduced liver fat, DNL, and VAT; and improved insulin sensitivity, secretion, and clearance in children with obesity and metabolic syndrome. The improvements in these outcome measures occurred irrespective of baseline liver fat content or weight change. These results suggest that fructose consumption and hyperinsulinemia are important determinants of DNL and liver fat, at least in high sugar consumers. These short-term data support an intervention focusing on fructose restriction as an approach to both combat NAFLD and improve insulin kinetics. Further studies will be required to determine the efficacy of long-term fructose restriction as a means of preventing or reversing NAFLD and its associated metabolic sequelae. Nonetheless, this study provides evidence that support recent public health efforts to reduce sugar consumption as a means to improve metabolic health.
