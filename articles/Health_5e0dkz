VPublic health authorities in the United States are recommending that men, women and children reduce their exposure to sunlight, based on concerns that this exposure will promote skin cancer. On the other hand, data show that increasing numbers of Americans suffer from vitamin D deficiencies and serious health problems caused by insufficient sun exposure. The body of science concerning the benefits of moderate sun exposure is growing rapidly, and is causing a different perception of sun/UV as it relates to human health. Melanoma and its relationship to sun exposure and sunburn is not adequately addressed in most of the scientific literature. Reports of favorable health outcomes related to adequate serum 25(OH)D concentration or vitamin D supplementation have been inappropriately merged, so that benefits of sun exposure other than production of vitamin D are not adequately described. This review of recent studies and their analyses consider the risks and benefits of sun exposure which indicate that insufficient sun exposure is an emerging public health problem. This review considers the studies that have shown a wide range health benefits from sun/UV exposure. These benefits include among others various types of cancer, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer disease/dementia, myopia and macular degeneration, diabetes and multiple sclerosis. The message of sun avoidance must be changed to acceptance of non-burning sun exposure sufficient to achieve serum 25(OH)D concentration of 30 ng/mL or higher in the sunny season and the general benefits of UV exposure beyond those of vitamin D.\u000a\u000aIntroduction Public health authorities in the United States are currently advising that human sun exposure be reduced.1 The Surgeon General's Call to Action to Prevent Skin Cancer, U.S. Department of Health and Human Resources, Office of the Surgeon General, Washington, D.C ; 2014. http://www.surgeongeneral.gov; Sun Exposure, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/sun-exposure; Guidelines for School Programs to Prevent Skin Cancer, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/skin/what_cdc_is _ doing/guidelines.htm; How Can I Protect My Children from the Sun?, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/skin/basic_info/children.htm; What Can I Do to Reduce My Risk of Skin Cancer?, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention http://cdc.gov/cancer/skin/basic_info/prevention.htm. At the same time, NHANES data show that 32% of Americans suffer from vitamin D insufficiency.aa The 2010 Institute of Medicine vitamin D report defined vitamin D deficiency as serum 25(OH)D levels of less than 12ng/mL and vitamin D insufficiency as serum 25(OH)D levels of less than 20 ng/mL.2 Steenbock H, Black A. Fat-soluble vitamins XXIII. The induction of growth-promoting and calcifying properties in fats and their unsaponifiable constituents by exposure to light. J Biol Chem 1925; 64:263-98. NHANES data for 20012006 show that 8% of Americans had 25(OH)D below 12 ng/mL and 32% had 25(OH)D below 20 ng/mL.3 Looker AC, Johnson CL, Lacher DA, Pfeiffer CM, Schleicher RL, Sempos CT. Vitamin D Status: United States, 20012006. NCHS Data Brief, No. 59, March 2011.View all notes In this paper we review the current state of the science of the risks and benefits of sun exposure and suggest that public health advice be changed to recommend that all men, women and children accumulate sufficient non-burning sun exposure to maintain their serum 25hydroxyvitaminD [25(OH)D] levels at 30 ng/mL or more year-round.\u000a\u000aHistory The first scientifically-established health benefit of sun exposure was the discovery in 1919 that sunlight cured rickets.4-5 Huldshinsky K. Heilung von rachitis durch kunstlich hohen-sonne. Deut Med Wochenscher 1919; 45:712-3; http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0028-1137830\u000a\u000aHuldshinsky K. The ultra-violet light treatment of rickets. Alpine Press New Jersey, USA 1928, 3-19.\u000a\u000aHess AF, Unger LL. The cure of infantile rickets by sunlight. JAMA 1921; 77:39-41. This was followed in 1924 up by the discovery that an inactive lipid in the diet and skin could be converted by UV light into an antirachitic substance.6 Steenbock H, Black A. Fat-soluble vitamins XXIII. The induction of growth-promoting and calcifying properties in fats and their unsaponifiable constituents by exposure to light. J Biol Chem 1925; 64:263-98. The identification of vitamin D occurred in 1931.7 Askew FA, Bourdillon RB, Bruce HM, Jenkins RGC, Webster TA. The distillation of vitamin D. Proc R Soc 1931; B107:76-90. The association between sun exposure and reduced cancer mortality in North America was identified in the 1960s. In the 1980s, it was hypothesized that vitamin D was the protective factor. For most of the intervening years, instead of pursuing further benefits of sun exposure, scientific inquiry focused on the health risks of sun exposure, especially melanoma and other types of skin cancer.8 Albert MR, Ostheimer KG.

In:Lowe NJ, Shaath NA, editors. Sunscreens: development, evaluation and regulatory aspects. New York: M. Dekker. 1990:3-35. Avoidance of intentional sun exposure and use of chemical sunscreens persisted as the standard advice of physicians and public health authorities for reducing the risk of melanoma and other forms of skin cancer.1,8 The Surgeon General's Call to Action to Prevent Skin Cancer, U.S. Department of Health and Human Resources, Office of the Surgeon General, Washington, D.C ; 2014. http://www.surgeongeneral.gov; Sun Exposure, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/sun-exposure; Guidelines for School Programs to Prevent Skin Cancer, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/skin/what_cdc_is _ doing/guidelines.htm; How Can I Protect My Children from the Sun?, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/skin/basic_info/children.htm; What Can I Do to Reduce My Risk of Skin Cancer?, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention http://cdc.gov/cancer/skin/basic_info/prevention.htm.\u000a\u000aAlbert MR, Ostheimer KG.

Recently, however, scientific inquiry has increasingly turned to the benefits of moderate sun exposure and the public health risks of inadequate sun exposure.10 van der Rhee H, de Vries E, Coomans C, van de Velde P, Coebergh JW.

Melanoma and genetics. Clinics in Dermatol 2009; 27:46-52; http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clindermatol.2008.09.005 The principal identified non-genetic risk factor is ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure, and the relationship between melanoma and UVR is 2-sided: non-burning sun exposure is associated with a reduced risk of melanoma, while sunburns are associated with a doubling of the risk of melanoma.12 Gandini S, Sera F, Cattaruzza MS, Pasquini P, Abeni D, Boyle P, Melchi CF.

The incidence of melanoma in the United States has increased dramatically from 1 per 100,000 people per year in 1935 to 23 per 100,000 per year in 2012. Various explanations for this phenomenon have been suggested, including diagnostic drift,30 Levell JN, Beattie CC, Shuster S, Greenberg DC. Melanoma epidemic: a midsummer night's dream?

This proposal was apparently ignored as precautions against melanoma focused on sun avoidance and liberal use of chemical sunscreens, with inadequate attention paid to the role of sunburns in melanomagenesis and to the role of vitamin D in inhibiting cancer. The first cancer cell line shown in 1980 to be inhibited in growth by 1,25(OH) 2 D was in fact a melanoma cell line. In 1989 Gallagher et al.41 Gallagher RP, Elwood JM, Yang CP.

We can find no consistent evidence that use of chemical sunscreens reduces the risk of melanoma. Green et al. 2011,42 Green AC, Williams GM, Logan V, Strutton GM. Reduced melanoma after regular sunscreen use: Randomized trial follow-up.

However, since the participants were told they were participants in a skin cancer prevention trial and were questioned periodically during the trial on their use of sunscreen, the likelihood that they were significantly more diligent in applying sunscreen in accordance with manufacturers' instructions than ordinary users of sunscreen cannot be discounted.ee Sunscreens are intended to prevent sunburn when used in thickness and frequency recommended by manufacturers or used in setting SPFs. However, studies have shown that the incidence of sunburn is higher or the same in people who almost always use sunscreens compared with those who rarely use sunscreens.43-45 Neale R, Williams G, Green A.

Use of a placebo sunscreen was barred by ethical concerns. Sunscreens do, however, reduce acclimatization to UVR and vitamin D production in the skin.46 https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/ Since public health authorities recommend liberal use of sunscreens for good health, the labeling of sunscreens should contain a statement about the possibility of vitamin D deficiency that may result from excessive use of sunscreens. Labeling should also state that sunscreens have not been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of melanoma. Sunscreens have been shown in one study to be effective in reducing the risk of squamous cell, but not basal cell, skin cancer.47 van der Pols JC, Williams GM, Pandeya N, Logan V, Green AC. Prolonged prevention of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin by regular sunscreen use.

One group of investigators examined Medicare fee-for-service data, extrapolated to the entire United States population, and estimated that 2,152,500 persons were treated for 3,507,693 NMSCs in 2006.48 Rogers HW, Weinstock MA, Harris AR, Hinckley MR, Feldman SR, Fleischer AB, Coldiron BM.

It is not clear in this analysis that all treatments for NMSCs were in fact treatments for malignancies rather than for non-cancerous lesions, and these investigators found the ratio of BCC to SCC to be 1 to 1 instead of the expected 4 to 1.

Assuming a 4 to 1 ratio of BCC to SCC, this would indicate that 2.5 million NMSCs are treated annually. This study found that the incidence of BCC increased 17% during the 15-year period from 1998 to 2012. As with melanoma, sunburns are associated with increased risk of SCC and BCC.16,17,51 Kennedy C, Bajdik CD, Willemze R, de Gruijl FR, Bavinck JNB.

BMJ 2014; 348:g1903; PMID:24690623; http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.g1903 performed a meta-analysis of data from 73 cohort studies with 849,000 participants and 22 randomized controlled trials with 31,000 participants. This study found an inverse association of circulating 25(OH)D with risks of death due to cardiovascular diseases, cancer and other causes (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.221.49 for all cause mortality, comparing the bottom third versus top 2-thirds of baseline circulating 25(OH)D distribution), but found that, with respect to possible benefits of vitamin D supplementation, further investigation is required before any widespread supplementation occurs. The prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency (defined as 25(OH)D less than 30 ng/mL) was found to be 69.5% for the United States and 86.4% for Europe. The authors further estimate that 9.4% of all deaths in Europe and 12.8% in the United States could be attributable to vitamin D insufficiency.

UV exposure inhibits intestinal tumor growth and progression to malignancy in intestine-specific Apc mutant mice kept on low vitamin D diet. Int J Cancer 2014; 136:271-7; PMID:24890436; http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ijc.29002 showed for the first time the causality of the relationship between moderate UVR exposure and primary intestinal tumors in mice. The UVR-induced reduction in intestinal cancer in mice could at least in part be attributed to vitamin D. However, the investigators also found a reduced progression to malignancy as a result of UVR exposure which appeared not to be attributable to vitamin D. Three groups of hairless mice were compared: one on a low-vitamin D diet without vitamin D supplementation or UVR exposure, one on a low-vitamin D diet with vitamin D supplementation but without UVR exposure, and one on a low-vitamin D diet without vitamin D supplementation but with moderate UVR exposure. This permitted the comparison of effects of dietary vitamin D supplementation and UVR exposure. The tumor load (area) was similarly and significantly reduced in both the vitamin D supplementation group and the UVR exposure group, but only the UVR exposure group had a lower percentage of malignant adenocarcinomas. Thus the study provided the first experimental evidence that physiologically relevant, moderate UVR exposure can reduce the load of primary intestinal tumors, which reduction can at least in part be explained by an increase in vitamin D status as a comparable reduction in tumor load was observed in the vitamin D supplementation group that had a similar increase in vitamin D status. However, a reduction in malignant progression and growth of adenocarcinomas could not be attributed to vitamin D as these effects were only observed with moderate UVR exposure and not with dietary vitamin D supplementation.

The 2010 IOM report64 Institute of Medicine. Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium and Vitamin D. Chatper 4.

Notably, the most recent, and only observational, study reviewed in the IOM report found no association of vitamin D supplementation with colon cancer risk, but found that patients in the highest quintile of prediagnostic circulating 25(OH)D concentration (more than 40 ng/mL) had a 42% reduced risk of colon cancer as compared to patients with the lowest quintile (less than 10 ng/mL).79 Jenab M, Bueno-de-Mesquita HB, Ferrari P, van Duijnhoven FJ, Norat T, Pischon T, Jansen EH, Slimani N, Byrnes G, Rinaldi S, et al.

Int J Epidemiol 1980; 9:227-31; PMID:7440046; http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ije/9.3.227 The authors conducted a systematic review to verify if epidemiological evidence is in line with the hypothesis that the possible preventive effect of sunlight on cancer is more than just the effect of vitamin D. Vitamin D intake studies were excluded from the review and the authors stated that their review presented the sum of epidemiological knowledge on the influence of sun exposure and circulating 25(OH)D levels on the risk of colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). They concluded that: 1) there is an inverse association between sun exposure and both colorectal cancer risk and colorectal cancer mortality; 2) there is an inverse association between vitamin D status and both colorectal cancer risk and colorectal cancer mortality; 3) there is a negative association between sun exposure and prostate cancer risk and prostate cancer mortality but not between vitamin D status and prostate cancer risk or mortality; 4) there is an inverse correlation between sun exposure and breast cancer risk and breast cancer mortality, and possibly between 25(OH)D and breast cancer mortality, but studies on the association between 25(OH)D and breast cancer risk are inconclusive; 5) there is a negative association between sun exposure and NHL risk and NHL mortality but not between vitamin D status and NHL risk or mortality; 6) there is a negative association between sun exposure and lymphoma risk, but no association between lymphoma risk and vitamin D intake or 25(OH)D levels; and, 7) for multiple sclerosis, both experimental and epidemiological studies show that the preventative role of sun exposure is independent of vitamin D production. The authors concluded that for colorectal cancer and breast cancer the benefit of sun exposure is mediated by high vitamin D levels produced by sun exposure, whereas for prostate cancer, NHL and multiple sclerosis the benefit of sun exposure is independent of vitamin D.84 van der Rhee H, Coebergh JW, de Vries E.

The investigators found that participants with serum 25(OH)D levels below 10 ng/mL were more than twice as likely to develop Alzheimer disease than participants with serum 25(OH)D levels greater than 20 ng/mL (HR 2.22, 95% CI 1.024.83) and participants with serum 25(OH)D levels of 10 ng/mL to 20 ng/mL were 69% more likely to develop Alzheimer disease than participants with serum 25(OH)D levels greater than 20 ng/mL (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.062.69). Similar results were obtained for all-cause dementia. According to the authors, this was the first large, prospective, population-based study incorporating a comprehensive adjudicated assessment of dementia and Alzheimer to examine their relationship with vitamin D concentrations. This study confirms other recent studies linking low vitamin D levels with cognitive decline.96-102 Keeney JTR, Frster S, Sultana R, Brewer LD, Latimer CS, Cai J, Klein JB, Porter NM, Butterfield BA.

Similar conclusions were made about 2 other autoimmune diseases, type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. The authors concluded that it was critical to consider the benefits of sun exposure as well as the risks, and to provide information to the public on the minimum sun exposure required for beneficial health effects as well as the maximal sun exposure to avoid the adverse health effects associated with excessive sun exposure.

The investigators noted that topical vitamin D derivatives and UVB radiation are used in the treatment of psoriasis. Vitamin D status was found to be unrelated to levels of self-reported sun exposure, but the measure used for sun exposure, which was minutes per day of sun exposure from March to September, may not have been appropriate for vitamin D production since it apparently did not include the time of day or the area of skin exposed.\u000a\u000aLiver disease Gorman et al. 2015119 Gorman S, Black LJ, Feelisch M, Hart PH, Weller R.

Diabetes 2014; 63:3759-69; PMID:25342734; http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db13-1675 suggests that UVR exposure may be an effective means of suppressing the development of obesity and metabolic syndrome through mechanisms that are independent of vitamin D but dependent on other UVR-induced mediators such as nitric oxide. This study investigated whether UVR and/or vitamin D supplementation had an effect on the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes in mice fed a high-fat diet, and found that UVR significantly suppressed weight gain but vitamin D supplementation did not. These results indicate that low vitamin D status in obese persons may only be a marker for low UVR exposure or a result of sequestration of vitamin D in adipose tissue, and provide a new view of previous studies showing a consistent association between increasing body mass index and lower serum 25(OH)D levels.127 Vanlint S.

The likely mechanism for this protective effect is visible light stimulating release of dopamine from the retina, which inhibits increased axial elongation, the structural basis of myopia.

A recent study showed that UVR exposure significantly raised circulating plasma -endorphin levels in a UV-exposure mouse model, leading to suggestions that UVR exposure is addictive.140 Fell GL, Robinson KC, Mao J, Woolf CJ, Fisher DE. Skin Beta-Endorphin Mediates Addiction UV Light.

The benefits of serotonin and -endorphin, as well as the effects of sun exposure on melatonin, photodegradation of folic acid, immunumodulation, photoadaptation, and circadian clocks, are reviewed in van der Rhee et al. 2016.10 van der Rhee H, de Vries E, Coomans C, van de Velde P, Coebergh JW.

The amount of sun exposure required to produce this level of vitamin D varies among individuals and according to time of year, time of day and latitude. White people with Type II skinshh There are 6 categories of skin on the Fitzpatrick Scale: Type I Very Fair White - always burns, never tans;Type II Fair White - usually burns, tans minimally; Type III Cream White  sometimes mild burn, gradually tans; Type IV Brown  rarely burns, tans with ease; Type V Dark Brown  very rarely burns, tans very easily; Type VI Black  never burns, tans very easily.View all notes at 40 degrees latitude can obtain their annual requirements of vitamin D by spending about 15 minutes in the sun with face, arms and legs exposed (half that time if in a bathing suit) 2 to 3 times a week between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. during the months of May through October.141 Kroll MH, Bi C, Garber CC, Kaufman HW, Liu D, Caston-Balderrama A, Zhang K, Clarke N, Xie M, Reitz RE, et al.

The risks of inadequate non-burning sun exposure include increased risks of all-cause mortality, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, obesity, Alzheimer disease, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, statin intolerance, macular degeneration and myopia. People with darker skins require more time in the sun to produce their requirements of vitamin D but also have lower risks of nonmelanoma skin cancer, and people with Type I skins, who are unable to tan, require less time in the sun but have higher risks of nonmelanoma skin cancer. All persons should avoid sunburns, which are associated with substantial increased risk of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer.\u000a\u000aConclusions Insufficient sun exposure has become a major public health problem, demanding an immediate change in the current sun-avoidance public health advice. The degree of change needed is small but critically important. The public must be advised to obtain enough sun exposure and vitamin D supplementation to maintain a serum 25(OH)D level of at least 30 ng/mL. The skin has a large capacity to produce vitamin D and a single whole body exposure to an amount of sunlight that is equal to 1 minimal erythemal dose is equivalent to ingesting approximately 15,00020,000 IUs of vitamin D. Therefore to produce an equivalent of 4000 IUs of vitamin D a day would require that 50% of the body surface be exposed to 0.5 MEDs. To achieve a blood level of at least 30 ng/ML would require ingesting 2000 IUs of vitamin D daily which would be equivalent to 25% of the body surface exposed to 0.5 MEDs 23 times a week.24 Wacker M, Holick MF. Sunlight and vitamin D: A global perspective for health. Dermato-Endocrinol 2013; 5:51-108; http://dx.doi.org/10.4161/derm.24494 The amount of sun exposure required to achieve an MED depends on skin pigmentation, latitude, time of day and time of year. Warnings on the dangers of sunburn at any age should be emphasized. Periodic testing of serum 25(OH)D levels is also reasonable especially at the end of the summer which is when the blood level of 25(OH)D is at its highest level.141 Kroll MH, Bi C, Garber CC, Kaufman HW, Liu D, Caston-Balderrama A, Zhang K, Clarke N, Xie M, Reitz RE, et al.
