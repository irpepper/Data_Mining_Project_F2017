VExogenous cannabinoids such as marijuana exert their influence through cannabinoid receptors. Endogenous cannabinoids such as anandamide (AEA) function through the same receptors, and their physiological roles are a subject of intense study. Here, we show that AEA plays a pivotal role in maintaining immunological health in the gut. The immune system in the gut actively tolerates the foreign antigens present in the gut through mechanisms that are only partially understood. We show that AEA contributes to this critical process by promoting the presence of CX3CR1 hi macrophages, which are immunosuppressive. These results uncover a major conversation between the immune and nervous systems. In addition, with the increasing prevalence of ingestion of exogenous marijuana, our study has significant implications for public health.\u000a\u000aEndogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids) are small molecules biosynthesized from membrane glycerophospholipid. Anandamide (AEA) is an endogenous intestinal cannabinoid that controls appetite and energy balance by engagement of the enteric nervous system through cannabinoid receptors. Here, we uncover a role for AEA and its receptor, cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), in the regulation of immune tolerance in the gut and the pancreas. This work demonstrates a major immunological role for an endocannabinoid. The pungent molecule capsaicin (CP) has a similar effect as AEA; however, CP acts by engagement of the vanilloid receptor TRPV1, causing local production of AEA, which acts through CB2. We show that the engagement of the cannabinoid/vanilloid receptors augments the number and immune suppressive function of the regulatory CX3CR1 hi macrophages (M), which express the highest levels of such receptors among the gut immune cells. Additionally, TRPV1 / or CB2 / mice have fewer CX3CR1 hi M in the gut. Treatment of mice with CP also leads to differentiation of a regulatory subset of CD4 + cells, the Tr1 cells, in an IL-27dependent manner in vitro and in vivo. In a functional demonstration, tolerance elicited by engagement of TRPV1 can be transferred to nave nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice [model of type 1 diabetes (T1D)] by transfer of CD4 + T cells. Further, oral administration of AEA to NOD mice provides protection from T1D. Our study unveils a role for the endocannabinoid system in maintaining immune homeostasis in the gut/pancreas and reveals a conversation between the nervous and immune systems using distinct receptors.\u000a\u000aThe endocannabinoid system (ECS) is highly conserved in evolution dating back to at least 600 million years (1). It consists of (i) lipid endocannabinoids; (ii) their receptors such as the G protein-coupled receptors, cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), and a ligand-gated cation channel vanilloid receptor 1 (i.e., TRPV1); and (iii) the enzymes such as fatty acid amide hydrolyase (FAAH) that regulate the levels of endocannabinoids in vivo (2). The ECS impacts several aspects of mammalian physiology, particularly in the gut. Endogenous cannabinoids such as anandamide (AEA) belong to the N-acylethanolamine family and are synthesized from membrane glycerophospholipids (3, 4). AEA is an intestinal endocannabinoid, which engages its cognate receptors on the enteric nervous system and contributes to control of appetite and energy balance (5). Here, we have unraveled a role of the ECS in regulating immune homeostasis in the gutpancreas axis.\u000a\u000aThe intestinal immune system is continuously exposed to a variety of antigens. An effective immune response must be launched against pathogenic insults; however, it must maintain tolerance to the vast amount of antigens such as those in commensal flora, endogenous metabolites, and food components. Mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) such as CX3CR1hi macrophage (M) and CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs), which are present abundantly in the small intestinal lamina propria (siLP), play an instrumental role in maintaining this exquisite balance between inflammation and tolerance (6).\u000a\u000aOn the basis of expression level of the chemokine receptor CX3CR1, two functionally and phenotypically distinct populations of MNPs in the gut have been identified. Although both populations differentiate from blood derived monocytes, CX3CR1hi M are regulatory in nature, whereas CX3CR1lo cells are perpetuators of inflammation (7). Adoptive transfer of CX3CR1hi M provide protection from inflammatory diseases like colitis in mouse models (8). However, the microenvironment signal that educates the monocytes and promotes differentiation into CX3CR1hi (as opposed to CX3CR1lo) M still remains elusive. It is increasingly appreciated that the MNPs play a crucial role in gut equilibrium. Identifying key elements that condition the siLP MNPs to become tolerogenic will enable exploration of strategies that can be helpful in providing protection from inflammatory diseases.\u000a\u000aThe studies described here connect the nervous system (responsible for sensing exogenous cannabinoids such as marijuana, as well as endogenous ones) to one of the most fundamental properties of the immune system, i.e., maintenance of an immune tolerant environment in the gut. These studies have a bearing on marijuana use and abuse, particularly with respect to the formulations meant for ingestion, and very significantly, for new avenues of understanding and treating human diseases.\u000a\u000aResults\u000a\u000aCX3CR1hi M Express the Highest Levels of ECS Receptors CB2 and TRPV1. siLP cells were isolated after removing the Peyers patches (PPs), and cell suspensions obtained were analyzed. Fig. S1A depicts the gating strategy to identify the different cell populations. The SSChi cells were gated for CD11b+SiglecF+ cells (i.e., eosinophils) and the SSClo cells for lymphocytes (B220+ and CD3+) and the MNPs. Phenotypic characterization of the MNPs was based on the expression of integrins CD11b (M), CD11c (X), CD103 (E), and the chemokine receptor CX3CR1. Special attention was paid to the CX3CR1 phenotype because CX3CR1hi M but not the CX3CR1lo cells play a significant role in immune homeostasis (7). To facilitate the identification of CX3CR1hi and CX3CR1lo cells, we used the CX3CR1+/gfp reporter mice in which GFP expression is a marker for CX3CR1 expression (9). As a quality-control measure, cell suspensions derived from siLP of these mice were stained with antibody against CX3CR1 and also checked for GFP by flow cytometry. The two patterns were consistent (Fig. S1B). We classified the MNPs as R1 (CD11b+CD11c+) and R2 (CD11bCD11c+). R1 was further subclassified into CD11b+CD11c+CX3CR1hi, CD11b+CD11c+CX3CR1lo, and CD11b+CD11c+CD103+, and, in the R2, we looked for CD11bCD11chiCD103+ (Fig. S1A, Bottom). Selected populations were analyzed for the expression level of TRPV1 (Fig. S1C) and CB2 (Fig. S1D). Of note, the MNPs expressed higher levels of TRPV1 and CB2 compared with the lymphocytes and eosinophils. Strikingly, CX3CR1hi cells expressed higher levels of TRPV1 and CB2 compared with the other cells analyzed (Fig. 1A). This finding was corroborated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis of mRNA levels of TRPV1 and Cnr2 (gene encoding CB2) on the various gut immune populations (Fig. S1E). Because of the substantial overlap in surface phenotype of intestinal DCs and M, designation of CX3CR1hi cells as DCs or M is debatable. However, Tamoutounour et al. have shown that expression of CD64 (the high-affinity FcR1) and absence of CD103 can be used in combination with CD11c and MHCII to definitively define functionally distinct M in intestine of mice (10). The population predominantly expressing TRPV1 and CB2 was found to meet these criteria (Fig. 1B, Top). Consistent with Tamoutounour et al., we show that CX3CR1lo cells are a heterogeneous population comprising of M (CD64+) and DCs (CD64; Fig. S2A). Previous reports demonstrate that CX3CR1hi M make IL-10 ex vivo without stimulation (7). The IL-10producing capacity of the CX3CR1hi M was tested ex vivo without any stimulation by using the IL-10GFP reporter mice (11); it was observed that CX3CR1hi M express high levels of IL-10 (Fig. 1B, Bottom). Thus, TRPV1 and CB2, which are integral components of the ECS, are preferentially expressed by the CX3CR1hi regulatory M. View larger version: Download PPT Fig. 1.

Given the high expression of TRPV1 and CB2 on CX3CR1hi M, we analyzed the role of each receptor. For TRPV1, we back-crossed TRPV1/ mice (12) with CX3CR1gfp/gfp reporter mice to obtain CX3CR1gfp/+ TRPV1/ mice. We validated the expression of functional (i.e., WT) allele and GFP allele for CX3CR1 and the absence of TRPV1 by PCR (Fig. S2B). Introduction of GFP disrupts the expression of endogenous CX3CR1 such that a homozygous mice does not express functional CX3CR1 protein whereas heterozygous mice do, and the expression of CX3CR1 in them can be followed through GFP. By analyzing the siLP cells of the CX3CR1gfp/+TRPV1/ mice, we observed that the absence of TRPV1 influences the frequency and number of CX3CR1+ cells differently: the frequency and number of CX3CR1hi M are reduced significantly (Fig. 1C, Middle), whereas, in case of the CX3CR1lo cells, there is a trend of decreasing number and frequency but the difference is not statistically significant (Fig. 1C, Bottom). These results in CX3CR1gfp/+TRPV1/ mice were also reproduced in TRPV1/ mice in which CX3CR1 was identified with antibody staining (Fig. S2C). The frequency and number of the other cells such as CD103+ DCs and CD3+ and B220+ cells remain unaffected in the absence of TRPV1 (Fig. S2 D and E). Next, we tested the importance of CB2 on the homeostasis of CX3CR1hi M by using mice genetically lacking CB2: the frequency and absolute number of CX3CR1hi M was significantly reduced in CB2-deficient mice (Fig. 1D, Middle). As in TRPV1/ mice, there is a trend of decreasing number and frequency among the CX3CR1lo cells in CB2/ mice as well, but the difference is not statistically significant (Fig. 1D, Bottom).\u000a\u000aStimulation of the ECS Leads to Expansion of CX3CR1hi M Population. CX3CR1gfp/+TRPV1/ mice underwent oral gavage with 10 g capsaicin (CP) or vehicle, and the siLP cells were isolated 24 h after treatment. CP-elicited changes in the MNPs were analyzed. CP significantly increased the frequency of the regulatory CX3CR1hi M but not the frequency and number of the CX3CR1lo cells (Fig. 2A). CP did not affect the frequency of CD11c+CD103+ DCs (Fig. S3A). To test if CP-mediated increase in CX3CR1hi M frequency was caused by enhanced proliferation, an in vivo BrdU incorporation assay was performed in mice that had undergone oral gavage with CP: feeding of CP did not result in incorporation of BrdU in CX3CR1hi M (Fig. S3B). We performed RNA sequencing and IsoEM/IsoDE analysis (13, 14) (as described in SI Materials and Methods) on the total MNPs of siLP to study the changes mediated by treatment with CP; the heat map for hierarchical clustering of the top 1,200 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) shows a clear presence of genes that are significantly up- or down-regulated by CP treatment (Fig. S3C). We used Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) Bioinformatic Resource, version 6.8, to study the functional-related gene groups and pathways. We found that CP treatment significantly enhances the cytokine/chemokine-mediated signaling pathways such as CCL2, CXCL12, CSF1, and IL-10 (Table S1). Thus, the increase in the frequency of CX3CR1hi M must derive from augmented migration or differentiation or a combination of both processes. View larger version: Download PPT Fig. 2. CP and AEA expand the CX3CR1hi M population in vivo.

(ns, not significant; data represent mean  SEM). View this table: Table S1. RNA-Seq of MNPs sorted from the siLP of CP- or vehicle-treated mice To distinguish between the contribution of TRPV1-expressing neurons vs. immune cells to the phenomenon shown in Fig. 2A, TRPV1/ mice reconstituted with bone marrow (BM) from TRPV1+/+ mice were treated with CP. The siLP CX3CR1hi M populations in all groups were monitored: CP-fed BM chimeric (BMC) mice behaved like the WT mice, indicating that TRPV1 expression on the hematopoietic cells was sufficient for activity. There was a notable, albeit statistically insignificant, difference between the expansion observed in the WT mice compared with the BMC mice, suggesting a possible, though not definitive, contribution from the neuronal TRPV1 in the process (Fig. 2B). The effect of oral administration of AEA, an endogenous compound capable of activating vanilloid and cannabinoid receptors, on CX3CR1hi M of siLP was examined. Oral administration of AEA led to a significant increase in the frequency of CX3CR1hi M (Fig. 2C, Bottom Left). As expected, we did not observe a difference in the frequency of CX3CR1lo cells after treatment with AEA (Fig. 2C, Bottom Right). We reasoned that, if administering exogenous AEA can affect the CX3CR1hi M, increasing the endogenous levels of AEA by inhibiting the enzyme that catabolizes it should yield similar results. Endogenous levels of AEA are controlled by the enzyme FAAH, which catabolizes AEA into arachidonic acid and ethanolamine (Fig. 2D, Top). Inhibition of FAAH, the enzyme that catabolizes AEA, increases the levels of AEA in the brain and peripheral tissues (15). Massa et al. demonstrated that mice genetically deficient in FAAH are protected from 2,4-dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis, highlighting the antiinflammatory role of AEA in the gut (16). Mice underwent gavage with an orally viable, irreversible FAAH inhibitor, PF3845, and the effect of this treatment on CX3CR1hi M in LP was examined 24 h after feeding. Treatment of mice with PF3845 increased the frequency of the regulatory M demonstrating that endogenous AEA can profoundly influence the homeostasis of CX3CR1hi M (Fig. 2D, Bottom).\u000a\u000aCP Induces AEA Production in Myeloid Cells. As shown here earlier, CP and AEA influence CX3CR1hi M in a similar manner. The potential of cross-talk between the two was investigated. AEA biosynthesis involves hydrolysis of a membrane phospholipid precursor N-arachidonoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE) by a phospholipase C to yield phospho-AEA (pAEA), which is then dephosphorylated by phosphatases such as the tyrosine phosphatase PTPN22; this process in M is associated with an increase of the level of PTPN22 (17) and a decrease in the level of phospholipase D NAPE-PLD (17). Consistent with this pattern, analysis of the transcriptome of siLP MNPs from CP-treated mice revealed that CP leads to increase in the expression of PTPN22 with a concomitant decrease in the level of NAPE-PLD (Fig. 3A, Top Left).

(DG) Mice underwent oral gavage with vehicle (Veh) or CP (10 g) or AEA (500 g), and siLP MNPs (CD11b+CD11c+ and CD11bCD11c+) were sorted after 24 h (D and G) and 48 h (E). (D) MNPs were sorted from CP-treated or vehicle-treated mice and cocultured (1:1) with nave splenic CD4+CD25CD62L+ T cells derived from WT (IL-27RA+/+) or IL-27RA/ mice for 4 d. Expression of IL-10 and IFN- among the CD4+ cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. Bar graphs represent the frequency of CD4+IL-10+ and CD4+IL-10+IFN-+ (Tr1) cells. (Data are representative of two independent experiments and show mean values  SEM of duplicate or triplicate determinations in which MNPs were sorted from 12 pooled mice per group).

(H) Female NOD mice were orally administered AEA or vehicle at 9th and 10th weeks of age, and urine glucose was monitored to study disease progression.

To explore this phenomenon mechanistically in a pure myeloid population (as opposed to in vivo, in which the effects could be indirect), the M cell line RAW264.7, which expresses TRPV1 (Fig. S4A), was used. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis of CP-treated cells shows that treatment with CP activates the AEA biosynthesis pathway as described earlier (Fig. 3A, Top Right). The changes in the expression levels of PTPN22 and NAPE-PLD in CP-treated RAW264.7 cells were validated by a qPCR analysis (Fig. 3A, Middle and Bottom). View larger version: Download PPT Fig. S4.

As shown in Fig. 2 A and C, oral administration of CP or AEA leads to expansion of the CX3CR1hi population in the siLP. This phenomenon was now tested in TRPV1/ and CB2/ mice. In TRPV1/ mice, CP failed to mediate expansion of CX3CR1hi cells, but AEA still did so (Fig. 3B, Top). As AEA has a higher binding affinity for CB2 than for TRPV1 (18), the same phenomenon was tested in CB2/ mice as well. Neither CP nor AEA mediated expansion of the CX3CR1hi population in the CB2/ mice (Fig. 3B, Bottom). These results (Fig. 3 A and B) indicate that AEA, through its interaction with CB2, is the final mediator of the expansion of the CX3CR1hi population in siLP upon oral administration of CP or AEA. The effect of CP is mediated through two steps: one, generation of AEA upon its interaction with TRPV1; and two, interaction of AEA with CB2.\u000a\u000aStimulation of ECS by AEA or CP Enhances the Tolerogenic Properties of MNPs and Provides Protection from Autoimmune Diabetes. IL-10 is a cytokine with potent tolerogenic and antiinflammatory properties (19, 20). It is particularly important in the gut, as it has been demonstrated that mice deficient in IL-10 develop spontaneous enterocolitis (21). We looked at IL-10 production as a measure of tolerogenicity in the CX3CR1hi M and CD103+ DCs 24 h after treatment with CP by using the IL-10 GFP-reporter mice. Compared with vehicle-treated mice, the CX3CR1hi M of CP-fed mice showed a significant increase in the production of IL-10 (Fig. 3C). CP treatment also resulted in a modest but statistically significant increase in IL-10 production in CD103+ DCs (Fig. S4B). The capacity of CP to alter the ability of the siLP MNPs to induce IL-10producing regulatory T cells was tested. The CX3CR1hi M and CD103+ DCs constitute the overwhelming majority of siLP MNPs; therefore, the total MNPs (CD11b+CD11c+ and CD11bCD11c+ cells; Fig. S4C) were sorted from mice treated with vehicle or CP 24 h earlier and cocultured with nave splenic CD4+ T cells (1:1) for 4 d, and IL-10 and IFN-producing CD4+ T cells were analyzed. CP-elicited MNPs led to a significant increase in the expression of IL-10 in the CD4+ T cells (Fig. 3D, Left). Additionally, CP-elicited MNPs led to significant increase in the induction of a population of CD4+ T cells that express IL-10 and IFN- (Fig. 3D, Right). CD4+ T cells, which produce IL-10 and IFN-, have been previously described as a potent regulatory subset called Tr1 cells (22). IL-27, a member of the IL-12 family, plays a dominant role in the induction of Tr1 cells (23). The requirement of IL-27 for the induction of Tr1 cells by CP-elicited MNPs was tested. Functional IL-27 receptor has two subunits, IL-27RA (WSX1) and gp130, gp130 being a common receptor shared with IL-6R family, whereas IL-27RA is specific to IL-27 signaling (24). The sorted MNPs were cocultured with nave CD4+ T cells from IL-27RA+/+ (WT) or IL-27RA/ mice: the increase in the frequency of CD4+IL-10+IFN-+ T cells seen in the presence of CP-elicited MNPs is completely abrogated in the T cells derived from the IL-27RA/ mice (Fig. 3D, Right). The possibility that CP treatment induces IL-27 production in the MNPs was tested. IL-27 (p28) levels were quantified by qPCR: at 2 d after CP treatment, there was a fivefold increase in the level of IL-27p28 in the MNPs (Fig. 3E). Altogether, these data suggest that (i) CP-elicited MNPs have a superior ability to induce a subset of regulatory T cells called Tr1 cells, (ii) this phenomenon is dependent on IL-27IL-27R interaction, and (iii) CP treatment makes the milieu in the gut more amiable for induction of IL-27 in the MNPs. We then tested the ability of CP to elicit such regulatory T cells in vivo. Two weeks after CP treatment, the frequency of CD4+IL-10+IFN-+ Tr1 cells in siLP was measured. Consistent with the differentiation of Tr1 cells in vitro, CP-fed mice showed expansion of Tr1 cells in siLP (Fig. 3F). We also tested the ability of AEA-elicited MNPs to induce Tr1 cells in vitro and observed that AEA-elicited MNPs did lead to a significant increase in the differentiation of Tr1 cells compared with vehicle-elicited MNPs (Fig. 3G). Given that the ECS promotes several aspects of tolerance-enhancing mechanisms, we tested the protective effect of AEA in context of type 1 diabetes (T1D). We observed (Fig. 3H) that orally gavaged AEA provided significant protection from T1D in a mouse model, as seen by us previously in CP-fed mice (25).\u000a\u000aLymph Node Specificity of Increase in the Number of Regulatory M by Stimulation of ECS. The pancreatic lymph node (PLN) is the first site in which initiation and priming of autoreactive T cells occur in context of T1D (26). Besides draining the pancreas, the PLN has been shown to drain the gastrointestinal tract (27). Hence, the PLN is located at the crux of the pancreas and the gut and can sample the environment of both. Turley et al. showed that perturbations in the gut can affect the quality of immune response in the PLN that in turn can alter the course of T1D (27). Based on this observation that establishes a strong immunological axis between the gut and the pancreas, we tested the possibility that ECS-mediated tolerance was evident in the PLN as well. The effect of oral administration of CP on the PLN M of nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice was tested. Engagement of TRPV1 led to a significant increase in the frequency of CD11b+CX3CR1+ cells (Fig. 4A). Given that the PLN of NOD mice is inflamed, we wanted to determine if CP-mediated effect on the PLN M is a universal phenomenon and whether it is affected by the absence of TRPV1. To answer these questions, TRPV1+/+ and TRPV1/ C57BL/6 mice underwent oral gavage with CP. Three days after CP administration, there was a significant increase in the frequency of CX3CR1+ M in the PLN of TRPV1+/+ mice but not in TRPV1/ mice (Fig. S5A). These data demonstrate that the ECS-mediated regulation of the PLN M is not restricted to NOD mice and that this phenomenon requires the presence of functional TRPV1. Although the PLNs and mesenteric lymph node (MLNs) drain the gut (27), the CP-elicited increase in the frequency of M was evident in the PLN but not in the MLN (Fig. S5B).

(A and B) Frequency of CD11b+CX3CR1+ cells among live FSChi cells of TPRV1+/+ or TRPV1/ mice in the PLN (A) and MLN cells (B) 3 d after oral gavage with CP (10 g; n = 79 mice per group). (C) Frequency of CP-elicited Tr1 cells among live PLN cells in IL-27RA+/+, IL-27RA/ and IL-27RA+/ mice (n = 34 mice per group). (*P < 0.05 and ****P < 0.0001, unpaired Students t test; data represent mean  SEM). The phenotype of the PLN M was examined and was observed to be akin to that of the siLP M (Fig. 1B) in terms of expression of CX3CR1, CD11c, MHCII, and CD64 and spontaneous production of IL-10 (Fig. 4B). The phenotypic similarity of the siLP and PLN M and the kinetics of the changes (changes in the siLP M were seen as early as 24 h after feeding with CP, whereas they were seen only after 3 d in the PLN) suggest that these M migrate from the gut to the PLN.
